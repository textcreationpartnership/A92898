            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot be amiſs, for preventing of miſapprehenſion or ſcandall, by way of Advertiſement, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh the <hi>READER,</hi> that the Authour (which is very obvious to be perceived) is a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, whoſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in what-ever repugnant to the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors intent is no way either to defend or promote. That ſome ſuch paſſages there may be (and indeed are, eſpecially in the Sixth <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf too groſly concerning the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Nouriſhment in the Sacrifice of the Altar, as they uſually phraſe it; as elſewhere glancing at Purgatory, and other the eſpouſed Tenents of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> enforced by the neceſsity of the Diſcourſe) is no wonder to any man of Ingenuity; the wonder is, that there are no more: All which, rather then to cauſe a Chaſme in the Work, and ſo be guilty of an incivility to the Author, are left
<pb facs="tcp:115672:3"/>to the Readers cenſure; and, which may give no ſmall ſatisfaction, the entire Peice delivered by way of Diſcourſe, far from any magiſterial dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matizing; ſo that with ſome, his modeſty may ſooneſt prove prejudiciall, which ſiding with no Party, doth therfore engage him upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive againſt all thoſe, who preſsing their opinions with too much heat, think all expreſsions crude, that are not peremptory. Beſides, the whole intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Author being to the praiſe and glory of the Grace of God, (which, how remarkable in a Romaniſt, and advantagious to Chriſtianity, none but a Pelagian will deny) will, I hope, make the whole Work at leaſt a paſſable Errour. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy affection to the Subject ſhall invite thee to buy, and thy charity to the Publiſher, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth himſelf no Maſter of Language, bear thee company when thou readeſt in pardoning his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and giving a candid interpretation to his Intentions; Thou wilt finde, as thy honour to be a Man, ſo thy perfection and happineſſe to be a Chriſtian man. In the mean time, referring thee to the Authors own Preface to uſher thee in to the following Treatiſes, the onely deſigne of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquium is, not at all to commend the Original;
<pb facs="tcp:115672:3"/>but to prevent, if poſsible, any prejudging the Tranſlation as ſcandalous to the Truths we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, by advancing contrary Doctrines under the diſguiſe of well-worded Theologie; which, if ſo, in the Authors native Stile, will even upon that ſcore perſwade none but thoſe who account all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions true becauſe handſome: whereas this being a Tranſlation, wants that vanity of allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having indeed the ſame face, but the eys put out. Read therefore, and let thy Charity give it light; or read not, and thou art charitable ſtill by leaving it in the dark; Every way 'tis at thy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy He that is ſeduc'd by what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is allow'd to guide. <hi>Farewel.</hi>

               <hi>The</hi> PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince 'tis the duty of Phyſicians to cure thoſe diſeaſes they have found out; me thinks, it concerns me, having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the miſeries of Man a Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to let you ſee the advantages of Man juſtified, and to ſearch in the purity of Grace the cure of Nature, corrupted by ſin. To acquit my ſelf of this obligation is my buſineſſe in this Work; where by an innocent Murder, I ſlay Man the Sinner, to give birth to Man the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>This ſeems to have been the principal deſigne of the Son of God, and that next to the Glory of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had no other motive for his Incarnation. Nature, though never ſo powerfull and wiſe, forms onely our body, and having prepared the organs for the operations of the ſoul, leaves Morality the care of completing what ſhe hath meerly decyphered: This goes a ſtep higher; and finding Liberty and Reaſon in Man, endeavours to husband them by her advice and precepts: But if ſhe be not aſſiſted by Faith, ſhe fils her diſciples with much vanity, and in ſtead of making them Men, many times renders them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>
            <p>Religion undertakes what Nature and Morality, corrupted, knew not how to accompliſh; ſhe tryes
<pb facs="tcp:115672:4"/>to form the Chriſtian Man by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, and in her School to teach him thoſe verities he has not been able to learn in thoſe of Philoſophers. To change his Inclinations, ſhe changeth his Beleef, and giving him another Principle then what he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at his Birth, makes him a new Creature. In this Work I deſcribe the miracles of Religion, I report the means ſhe uſeth to execute ſo high an Enterprize; and as in guilty Man I took notice of the devaſtations of Sin, in the Chriſtian Man I obſerve the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Grace. I conſider him in all his Conditions, and taking him at his Birth, I lead him to his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: I look upon all his advantages, and leſt Pride ſhould ruine him, I preſent him with all his infirmities, that perceiving what he hath drawn from <hi>Adam,</hi> and what he hath received from Jeſus Chriſt, he may ſhake hands with the firſt, and cloſe with the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Not to wander in ſo difficult a path, I have taken the Fathers of the Church for my Guides, I tread in the ſteps of thoſe Great Men ſhe reverenceth as her Maſters; and knowing very well that a man cannot eaſily fail with thoſe that deſtroy'd Hereſies, I ſtick to their opinions, that ſo I may not fall into Errour. But becauſe S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeems one of the moſt famous, and moſt ſound, he is one of thoſe I moſt diligently conſult: From the beams of this Sun I borrow my Light; I am inſtructed in the School of this Great Doctor, and after the example of the Church, I have drawn out of his Books the moſt part of thoſe Truths
<pb facs="tcp:115672:5"/>I deliver in This. And as I do not leſſe admire his profound Humility then his deep knowledge, I labour to profit by both, and defending his opinions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any eager heat, I not onely reverence all thoſe the Church doth not condemn, but I am ready to renounce all my own when-ever ſhe ſhall diſprove them.</p>
            <p>Having given the world this account of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, I conceive my ſelf oblig'd to make information of my proceeding and order in this Work: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote very few Conceits which are not ſupported by the Authority of the Fathers; and if ſomtimes I fail to relate their words faithfully, I beleeve I never ſwerve from their meaning. I have enriched my Margent with many paſſages which are not inſerted into the Diſcourſe; but I hope I have no wayes diſobliged the Reader in making him partaker of thoſe Treaſures I have diſcovered in Antiquity, nor that he will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, if, like a Prodigall, I keep no meaſure in my Largeſſes. For what concerns the order, I ſuppoſe I have very carefully obſerv'd it, avoyding that confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is often incident to Works of this length; and to impart ſome general Notion of what I intend to thoſe that ſhall take ſo much pains as to peruſe it, I will lay down a plain and eaſie Scheme, which ſhall preſent you with a ſhort proſpect of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Man.</p>
            <p>I begin the firſt Treatiſe with his Birth: which, as it is the fruitful ſource of all the Allyances he contracts with God, I cannot ſpeak of it ſoundly and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, without diſcovering ſome of his Qualities, and
<pb facs="tcp:115672:5"/>letting you ſee that aſſoon as he is regenerated, he is the adopted child of the eternal Father, becauſe he is the Temple of the holy Ghoſt, and the Brother of the Word Incarnate; To this I add ſome other Priviledges conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants of his Baptiſm, all which declare the miſery he hath avoided, and the happineſs he hath obtain'd.</p>
            <p>From thence I paſſe to the ſecond Treatiſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Spirit of the Chriſtian, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the obligations we have to follow his motions, to act according to his orders, and to obey his inſpirations, becauſe none are truly the children of God but thoſe that are quickned by his Spirit. <hi>Quicunque enim Spiritu Dei aguntur, ii ſunt Filii Dei.</hi> Rom. 8.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Chriſtian is but a part of a myſtical Body whereof there is a Head to guide it, as wel as a Spirit to enliven it; in the third Treatiſe I deſcribe the neer relations and cloſe connexions this glorious quality communicates to him with Ieſus Chriſt, the advantages he receives from thence, and the juſt duties he is obliged to return to this adored Head.</p>
            <p>The fourth Treatiſe diſcovers all the ſecrets of Grace, which ſeem to be nothing elſe but a ſacred chain uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chriſtian with the ſon of God and with the Holy Ghoſt, and putting him at their diſpoſal to be conducted ſafely in the way of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The vertues that flow from Grace, as ſtreams do from their fountain, are the ſubject of the fifth Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, demonſtrating a new Morality which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers were ignorant of, and which ſevering man from himſelf, faſtens him happily to his Principle.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as he lives by Grace and vertues, in the
<pb facs="tcp:115672:6"/>ſixth Treatiſe, I ſet before him a heavenly Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that preſerves his life, and withall affords him ſome pledges of Immortality. But becauſe this food is alſo a Victime, ſpeaking of his Nouriſhment, I ſpeak of his Sacrifice, and I lay down the juſt Reaſons the Chriſtian hath to offer up himſelf to God with Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Treatiſe I diſcourſe of his glorious Qualities which I had not touched in the former; wherein I make it appear, that being the Image of the Son of God, he is alſo a Prieſt and a Sacrifice, a Souldier and a Conqueror, a Slave and a Soveraign, a Penitent and an Innocent.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to compleat the Chriſtian, who is but rudely drawn in Baptiſm, &amp; who, as long as he is upon earth, is always imperfect, I lead him to Glory; where find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Happineſs in the knowledge and love of the ſupreme Good, he is happily transformed into God; There he patiently waits for the reſurrection of his Body, that the two parts whereof he is compoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reunited, there may be nothing wanting to the perfection of his happineſs, and that both Soul and Body being freed from the bondage of ſin, he may reign for ever with the Angels in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee in a few words the drift and ſcope of the whole Work: where, if I have repeated ſomething that I formerly delivered in the <hi>Guilty Man,</hi> it is becauſe the Cure depends upon the Diſeaſe, Subjects are illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by their contraries, and it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Advantages of Grace, without comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Miſeries of Sin.</p>

The Soul ſtoops below the priviledg of her Birth, to ſuccour the Infirmities of the Body; and the Body ſoares above the meaneſs of its Extraction, to be ſerviceable to the more noble operations of the Soul: If they are exerciſed at the provocation of ſome rebel-luſt, there is always found ſome common friend that takes up the difference: Self-love is content to ſet them at one, thereby to eſtabliſh his Empire over ſinners,

                  <p>But the Chriſtian is of ſuch a Compoſure that he can never taſte any peace in his perſon; Diviſion ſeems to conſtitute one part of his Eſſence, and till Glory ſhall put a period to his Controverſies, he is continually infeſted with a Domeſtick and inteſtine war. Though Repentance ſubdue the Body by its Auſterities, and Prayer elevate the Soul by its Raptures, both Soul and Body continually rebel againſt the Spirit of God:

This Parricide is innocent, all Chriſtians are obliged to commit it; neither doth Jeſus Chriſt acknowledge them for his children, who endeavour not to ſtrangle this Father, who made them liable to Death before he entitled them to Life.

He complains that he cannot utterly periſh in his off-ſpring, that he reigns there to this day againſt his will, and that for puniſhment of a ſin whereof he made them ſtand convicted before they were born, they continue to make him guilty after that he is dead.

The Baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is a burial wherein we bequeath ſin; and loſing the conſcience of the old man, we enter upon a ſecond Infancy by a new Nativity. In a word, the Baptiſm of our Saviour is a Tomb wherein we are buried, and a Cradle wherein we are born again: 'tis a pleaſant dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory where receiving a death beneficial, we receive withal a life far more glorious; and where leaving off to be Sinners, we begin to be Innocents.</p>
                  <p>In this it is that I admire the Providence of the Son of God, who made uſe of ſin to deſtroy ſin, as ſaith the Apoſtle of the Gentiles; <hi>De peccato damnavit peccatum;</hi> and changing his death into a ſacrifice, made it a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all our iniquities. For if Baptiſm make us die to ſin, it is upon no other ground, but becauſe it imprints in our ſouls the merit and image of the death of Chriſt, and by an inviſible, but a true and real grace, works in us a deſire to part with all that is derived from <hi>Adam.</hi> This makes the

Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> entertained the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> heretofore with theſe obligations; and expounding to them the doctrine of the Goſpel, taught them that Baptiſm engaged them in death. Jeſus Chriſt, ſaid he, was crucified, that you might be ſo to the world; he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed death, that you might die to ſin: he was buried, that you might be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him: and having put off the old man <hi>Adam,</hi> and being cloathed with the new man <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> you may die no more in your ſouls by ſin.</p>
                  <p>All the other Fathers ſpeak the ſame language, teaching us that there is a death and a life hid in Baptiſm, producing real effects in our ſouls. Thence ariſeth the inclination all Chriſtians have to die and to live: thence proceed thoſe obſtinate conflicts they entertain ſelf-love with: thence ſpring thoſe violent deſires to be ſeparated from the world and the fleſh, that they may be no longer ſubject to their tyranny.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this Myſtery very much concerns our ſalvation, it deſerves a more ample explication from us, that we may diſcloſe the truths and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that lie wrapt up in it. The Son of God is willing that as his death is the Principle, ſo it ſhould be the Rule and Example of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: as he died to deliver us, he would have us die to honour him: and as he entered not into glory but by the door of the Croſs, neither muſt we paſs to the reſurrection but by the gate of the Grave. He died, ſaith the great Apoſtle, that by his death he might ruine the Empire of ſin. He di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that loſing all the imperfections he drew from <hi>Adam,</hi> he might riſe again to life everlaſting. He died, that ſatisfying his Father, we might be no longer reſponſible to his Juſtice. All theſe conſiderations oblige us to die in Baptiſm:

                  <p>The ſecond condition of this ſtate, is, the duration that goes along with it: For though death be eternal in reſpect of the Creature, nor can any but an Almighty power re-unite the ſoul with the body when once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; yet there ſeems to remain ſome faint hope, as long as the body is not committed to the grave: we watch it, to ſee if that which appears a death, be but a ſwoon or trance: and there have been thoſe that have died and roſe again the ſame day, without a miracle. But when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is laid in the ſepulchre, drooping Nature is then paſt all hope. This diſmal abode hath no intercourſe with life: 'tis an everlaſting habitation whence there is no return but by a prodigie:

Thus the Chriſtians, when baptized, are as it were interred; to inſtruct them, that this death ought to be immortal, that the divorce which they have made with the world can admit of no accommodation, and that a departure accompanied with ſo ſolemn a funeral, ſhould in all reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the deſire and hope of the life of <hi>Adam.</hi>

He is quickned with a new ſpirit in Baptiſm; he taſtes the joys of heaven there: and the grace he receives in that holy Sacrament is not onely an Earneſt, but an Antepaſt and Prelibation of glory. His life is anſwerable to his dignity: having God for his Father, his pretenſions muſt needs be high; and deſpiſing whatever the world can promiſe, he aſpires at no leſs then the felicity of Angels. This is the conſolation of the faithful in their troubles; 'tis the reaſon the great Apoſtle makes uſe of, to ſweeten his travels: and as often as perſecution flats our ſpirits, he endeavours to raiſe them up again from the conſideration of the recompenſes that are prepared for us.</p>

We are, ſaith S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> like thoſe great trees which during the ſharpneſs of the winter are naked of all their leaves; their life is incloſed in their roots; their vigour is retired into their ſap; and all the ſoul and vegetation they have, is hid from the eyes of the beholders: but their death is conſpicuous; every branch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth it; and all the bavock winter hath made them feel, are ſo many arguments to make us doubt of their life. Thus it is with Chriſtians: they are dead, and they are alive: but their life is in a cloud, their death mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: the perſecutions they ſuffer, the temptations they conteſt with, the conflicts they undergo, perſwade Infidels that their life is but a languiſhing and doleful death: but their vigour is over-ſhadowed, their beauty is like that of the Spouſe, whoſe advantages are the fruits rather of her minde then of her body: their glory is retreated with Chriſt in God. And as the Spring muſt needs return, to convince the ignorant that a tree that hath loſt his leaves is not dead; ſo muſt the general Reſurrection happen, to aſſure unbelievers that a Chriſtian perſecuted by the world is alive with Chriſt in God. Let us die therefore with him, if we mean to live with him: and, to end this Diſcourſe with the words of S. <hi>Gregory</hi> cited by S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi>

'Tis <hi>Adam</hi> that deſtroys us;

                  <p>The firſt reſemblance is, that Sin precedes our knowledg; we are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents without knowing it, our Ignorance furniſheth us with no excuſe; and though we know not the Parent from whom we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, we fail not to be the heires of his obliquity. Thus the Remedy imitating the Diſeaſe, prevents our Reaſoning; we are abſolv'd in our Baptiſm without knowing our Redeemer; Grace enters into our ſoul, and brings no light along with it; it leaves us in the dark, and knocks off our chains;

                  <p>Beſides, the offence that was voluntary in <hi>Adam</hi> is naturall in his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they draw it in with their breath, it infects not their Will but becauſe it corrupts their Nature. This Sin was voluntary only in the firſt Man; his poſterity cannot hinder it; and as Infants have not the uſe of Reaſon, they are tranſgreſſors by the wil of their Father. We muſt riſe as high as Paradiſe to finde the Spring of our misfortune; we are unable without the help of faith, ſo much as to comprehend that we are guilty of a ſin committed in the Nonage of the world; and that without knowing or willing it, we do in the firſt moment of our Conception contract it.</p>

                  <p>But if the Diſeaſe be ſtrange we muſt needs acknowledg the Remedy is no leſs admirable. For Chriſtians are juſtified in Baptiſm by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, they enjoy his merits without asking for them, they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with his ſpoils, and entring into a Community of Goods with him, they have as much ſhare in His Innocence, as they had part in <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion. 'Tis not their Conſent that ſanctifies them, their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no effect of their Will; and if they ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, 'tis by the ſole Merits of Jeſus Chriſt. They believe in him as they doubted in <hi>Adam,</hi> and their Satisfaction being parallel to their Fault, they are Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Guilty in the perſon of their Fathers.</p>
                  <p>In the Third place, <hi>Adam</hi> lent us his Body in Paradiſe to make us Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals; We ſaw the forbidden fruit with his Eyes; We gather'd it with his Hands; We are it with his Mouth; and as if with Him we had committed all theſe ſins, We are to this day puniſh'd in all our members after his death: For whether we made up one part of him; whether he was a Univerſal and Generall Man, whereof all others are but the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; whether he perpetuates and tranſmits himſelf into his deſcendants; or whether having ſtipulated for us before God, his Crimes became ours,

                  <p>The Firſt is, That the Son of God was conceived by the operation of the holy Ghoſt: He it was that managed this great Deſigne, who curd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the moſt pure blood of the Virgin, who form'd the Body of the Word Incarnate, and becoming his principle, did in a manner give him in Time what he had received from him in Eternity.

                  <p>The Second Advantage of the Son of God in his temporall Nativity, is, That he had a Mother who miraculouſly united Fruitfulneſſe with Purity; for the Fruit that ſhe bare ſhed not her Flower; the quality of

The very Heathen were not ignorant of it: The Sybils have proclaimed it for the rareſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Virginity; and there were ſome people who (moved by their Predictions) erected Altars to the
<note n="*" place="margin">Virgini pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riturae.</note> Virgin-Mother. Nothing in all our Religion hath carried ſo much luſtre with it amongſt the Heathen, as this glorious particular; neither had they much adoe to beleeve that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the Son of God, ſeeing he was the Son of a Virgin: This Prerogative hath repaired the ſcandal of the Croſſe; and if ſome impious wretches have thought meanly of him when they knew he ſuffered upon a Gibbet, they could not chuſe but highly admire him when they learnt that he was born of a Virgin.

Though this be ſo extraordinary a Priviledge, that Chriſt never communicated it to any mortall (the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Monarchs are born of a woman that purchaſeth her condition of a Mother with the expenſe of that of a Virgin); yet hath he been pleaſed to honour every Chriſtian with the ſame favour: For they are born of the Church, who like <hi>Mary,</hi> is pure and teeming together: Their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is a Virgin; and as Age impairs not her fecundity, neither doth the number of her Progeny ſully her purity: She is delivered of them without ſorrow, as ſhe conceives them without ſin; and becauſe ſhe engenders the members of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe hath the ſame priviledge with her that brought forth their Head. <q>The Church is a Virgin, ſaith

Thus the Birth of Chriſtians is as glorious by their Mothers ſide, as by their Fathers; they have, as Chriſt their elder Brother, a God for their Principle, a Virgin for their Mother, and a Kingdom for their Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe Graces we may adde a Third, which is common to them with their Head, for the Holy Scripture ſilently hints that the word of the Virgin contributed ſomething to the production of her ſon; ſhe yeelded her conſent, before ſhe ſurrendred her wombe, ſhe ſpake to expreſs her intentions, and her word had ſo much vertue that it gave life to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

But if with our Myſteries we may raiſe our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations; let us ſay that the Virgin imitated the Eternal Father, and as He conceived his Son by ſpeaking, ſhe conceived him ſo too; ſhe declares his divine Originall, and becoming the Mother of him of whom he is the Father, ſhe begat him, if not by her Thought, at leaſt by her Word: Her ſacred Mouth began the work of our ſalvation, her Virgin-Womb finiſhed it, and aſſoon as the Holy Maid returned her anſwer, and contributed her blood, the Word was found Incarnate in her bowels.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs this Miracle would be without a Paralel, had Jeſus Chriſt no brethren: but ſince he was willing to honour them with all the Priviledges of his Nativity, he was pleaſed alſo that his Spouſe ſhould be fruitfull as his Mother was. Indeed, the Church produceth us by ſpeaking; the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that regenerates us receives the vertue from her words; and did not the Miniſters pronounce them when they baptiſe us, this Sacrament would have no power to give us a Being: 'Tis the lips of the Mother that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens us, her voice that draws us out of the boſome of death; neither would all the water of the ſea be able to waſh away the leaſt ſin, were it not enlivened with her word: Shee acts as her Beloved doth, makes things by her ſpeech, inſpires a ſecret vertue into the Elements, ennobles them above their nature, and by a miraculous impreſſion gives them an inſluence upon the ſoul: Shee imitates <hi>Mary,</hi> her ſpeech is prolificall; and as her production is ſpirituall, ſhe needs only ſpeak to enliven her children. What is water, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> without the Word of God in the mouth of the Church, but the commoneſt of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? but when quickned with her voice, it becomes fruitfull; and by the union of theſe two Principles together, the Sacrament is compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſins are abſolved, the dead are raiſed, Chriſtians are regenerated, and ſinners converted.</p>

Theſe cannot comprehend that the Son of Man is the Son of God; that he that is equall to the Father, is his ſervant; that he gives Orders, and receives them; that he commands, and obeyes; that he comes down upon the earth, and yet never leaves heaven; that he dies, and ſtill lives; that he is confin'd in a Sepulcher, and yet fills the whole world. This Miracle prepares us for the belief of another, no leſſe ſtrange then the former: For if we conſult the Holy Scriptures, we ſhall find that the Son of God was made the Son of man for no other end then to make us the Children of God; he was humbled, that we might be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and he hath facilitated the belief of our future greatneſs by the example of his debaſement. His birth is a pledge of ours, he was born of a woman, but to aſſure us that we might be born of God; neither was he apparelled with the fleſh in the womb, but to perſwade us that one day we ſhall be clothed with glory in the heavens: And this is the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the moſt illuminated of the Evangeliſts makes uſe of to eſtabliſh our ſecond Generation; for having taught us that Baptiſme and Faith give us God for our Father, fearing leſt ſo high a promiſe find no credit in our underſtanding,

But it is a thing very well worthy our admiration, to conſider, that he is adopted by a Father, who having an onely Son equal to himſelf, ſhould in reaſon caſt out all adopted chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were he not obliged to accept them at the intreaty of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Son.

Indeed tis a thing never heard of, that a Father to whom Nature hath given a Son, ſhould adopt another, and ſeek that in a ſtrange Family which he may find in his own: He would beleeve himſelf to offend againſt paternal charity, ſhould he divide it; and injurious to his Son, ſhould he aſſigne him co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heirs: Though this be his only one, he never reſolves to provide him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, neither hath he ever recourſe to this remedy, but when the death of his ſon makes it lawfull, in making it neceſſary. In the mean time the Eternal Father adopts us; though he have an immortal Son, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his affections to us, and admits us into his Family, to make us ſhare in his Inheritance.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:115672:21"/>
                  <p>But that which moſt furprifeth us in this Oeconomy, is, That he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes this deſigne at the requeſt of his Son, nor does he honour us with the condition of Children, till Jeſus Chriſt hath honoured us with that of Brethren: 'Tis one of the chiefeſt motives of his incarnation, and we may ſay, that he had never choſen a Mother upon earth, but that he might have Brethren in heaven. He is the onely begotten in the boſom of his Father: He ſhares not this quality with the Holy Ghoſt; and as their proceſſions are different, one is the Son, the other the Spirit of the Father; the One remains in his boſom, the Other in his heart; the One proceeds by Knowledge, the Other by Love. But this onely Son is firſt born of the chaſte ſpotleſs womb of the Virgin, by his temporal birth he gains Brethren, and clothing them with the robes of his merits, obligeth his Father to avow them for his Children: For we enjoy not this quality but after we are inſtated in the perſon of the Word: nor can we have God for our Father, but we muſt have Jeſus Chriſt for our Head: But when Grace hath made us his members,

Nature is blinde in her affections, as well as in her productions; ſhe knows not, for the moſt part, what ſhe does, her works are many times defective; and as if ſhe had loſt her light to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her innocence, ſhe brings forth Monſters as often as Men: In the mean time ſhe forbears not to love her imperfections; ſhe hath the heart of a Mother for all her productions, and compels parents many times to embrace Monſters, becauſe they are their children. In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, Adoption is much happier then Nature; it ſees what it admits of,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115672:22"/>chuſeth upon knowledge of the cauſe, loves that which is lovely and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nor does impart affections or goods but to perſons that merit them: Nevertheleſſe, contrary to all theſe rules, we finde, that the Eternal Father adopts children born in ſin, and having nothing but the Apennage of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> are rather the objects of his wrath, then of his love: He goes to ſeek them in the maſſe of perdition, he ſeparates them from the Guilty to render them innocent, and applyes to them the merits of his Son to make them worthy of his inheritance: For of all the Favours (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) God the Father was pleaſed to honour us with, he hath continually prevented our deſervings; he pardoned us in our delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, heaped honour upon us in our miſery: To wretches condemned to death he hath promiſed immortality; to the guilty, innocence; to baſe contemptible creatures, glory; to men, divinity; that we may receive all theſe favours as the gracious endearments of his mercy, and not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences of our merits. Thus our Adoption is founded upon his goodneſs; he choſe us but becauſe it was his good pleaſure; he hath made us his Children becauſe Chriſt hath made us his Brethren; and in the apprehenſion of ſo great an advantage, all we have to do, is to humble our ſelves at the ſight of our miſeries, and to give him thanks at the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his mercies.</p>
                  <p>But to the end that this grace may appear more precious, we muſt reckon up its Priviledges, and allow the reſt of this Diſcourſe to its more noble Excellencies. The Adoption of men is indeed an Allyance, but we may without offence call it an imaginary one; it hath no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but the affection of him that adopts, and the true or apparant merit of him that is adopted: the conjunction is ſo impotent, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth nothing reall in their minds; 'tis, as we have obſerved, a meer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, conſtituting no true relation between the two perſons it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites; and in this particular we muſt needs confeſs, 'tis much weaker then Nature: For this tyes men with fleſh and bloud, her chains are ſo ſtrong, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible to break them: The Father looks upon his Son as a piece of himſelf, the Mother beholds him as a portion of her own bowels; nor can the Son die, but both of them die in conceit with him. Adoption hath nothing of this vigour in it, it leans upon intereſts, and as ſoon as he that is adopted hath no more any hope, he hath no more love nor reſpect. But the Chriſtian Adoption is like that of Nature; the links that compoſe it are of Diamond,
<note place="margin">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115672:22"/>combining, that it imitates that that is between the Humanity and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity by the myſtery of the Incarnation. From the very inſtant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm the Chriſtian is truly the Son of God; the miſery of his Nature, the ſhame of his Birth, and the Crime of his firſt Father hinders not Jeſus Chriſt from being his Brother, the Church from being his Mother, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory from being his portion.</p>
                  <p>But I wonder not at all that the Adoption of Chriſtians is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial then that of men, ſince it is celebrated with greater pomp and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. For when a man intends to adopt a child, he needs only declare his will, and make uſe of the Princes authority to make his Adoption pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and valid; as ſoon as this Inſtrument is drawn, he that was but a ſtranger becomes a Son: But the Adoption of Chriſtians is as full of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries as of circumſtances; for the Son of God muſt make himſelf the ſon of man, muſt charge himſelf with our ſins, and enrich us with his merits, that ſatisfying the juſtice of his Father, he may oblige him to change his hatred into love, and to accept thoſe for his Children that he accounted his Enemies: The Chriſtian alſo muſt be waſhed in the waters of Baptiſm, muſt borrow the voyce of the Church to renounce the tyranny of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel and the pomp of the World; muſt put off Adam, and put on Jeſus Chriſt, that being filled with grace, and cleanſed from ſin, he may receive the benefit of Adoption: Under the ſhadows of theſe Ceremonies there are perform'd a hundred miracles, which faith only can diſcover: For an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement animated with the Word of God acts in the ſoul, and defaceth the ſpots ſin had imprinted there; Man changeth his condition, though not his nature; he that was a ſlave becomes free, and he that deſerved damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the fault of <hi>Adam,</hi> is accounted worthy of Glory by the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the laſt and rareſt Circumſtance of this Adoption is, that it admits Chriſtians into an inheritance not at all divided by the number of heirs. One of the greateſt misfortunes of the world is, that the goods are ſo ſmall,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſta quae appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, quia exigua ſunt, nec poſſunt ad altcrum niſi alteri erepta transferri; et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem affectanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus pugnam &amp; jurgia excitant.</hi> Senec. lib. 5. de Ira. cap. 35.</note> one man cannot be proprietary of them, without raviſhing them from another; every man impoveriſheth his neighbour to enrich himſelf: and humane prudence, that ſeeks for tranquillity in eſtates, hath not to this day been able to choak this unhappy ſeed, the root of all diſorders. Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns will reign alone in their Dominions, Fathers will be Maſters of their Families; both of them are jealous of their Children, nor do they invite them as partners in the poſſeſſion of their goods, becauſe they know very well they cannot be divided, but they muſt be leſſened. Death muſt take away the Father, that the Son may ſucceed him; ſo that the lawfulleſt Succeſſion in the world is never without grief, becauſe it can never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs. This unhappineſs proceeds certainly from the ſcantineſs of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods: for were they large enough to be parted without ſuffering a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, every one would poſſeſs them without jealouſie: Kings would not fear their Succeſſors, nor Fathers their Heirs: And as Light and Vertue
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115672:23"/>breed no quarrell amongſt thoſe that have them in their poſſeſſion, there would be no more War among Soveraigns, nor Law-ſuits among Subjects. This benefit is an inſeparable conſequence of the Adoption of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; Their Inheritance is ſo large, that the number of children cannot diminiſh it: The Good they hope for hath two properties that ſecure it from envie; it is one, and cannot be divided; it is infinite, and ſufficeth the whole world: its unity is the cauſe that every one poſſeſſeth it intire; its infinity, that none are affraid of a leſſening; they are all rich of the ſame ſubſtance, they are all happy by the ſame felicity; the difference of their condition troubles not their reſt, and this <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> though in diverſity of endowments, makes men neither envious nor proud: Every one is content with anothers proſperity, and with his own; and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that reigns among the Citizens of this heavenly Jeruſalem, doth ſo intimately unite their hearts, that the diverſity of particulars diſturbs not the happineſs of the whole. But that which compleats their content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the full, is, that death never ſeparates the children from their Father; he hath Heirs, but no Succeſſours; he deſpoils not himſelf to enrich them; but living and reigning with them, he conferrs all his goods upon them without loſing them: He himſelf is their everlaſting Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who fills their deſires, perfects all the powers of their ſoul, and communicates himſelf ſo abundantly, and ſo ſurely to his children, that as there is nothing they can fear, ſo neither is there any thing they can wiſh for.

Thus man obeys God before he hath an exiſtence, he is his Vaſſal before he is his Creature, and he ſubmits to his Orders before he can underſtand them: But if his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence precede his creation, his Allyance ſucceeds it; neither hath he any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with God, till he is made his workmanſhip: 'Tis in that inſtant that he enters into ſociety with him, when his ſpirit enlightned by Faith, knows the prime verity, and his will warm'd by love, ſeeks out for the ſoveraigne Good: Aſſiſted with this double ſuccour, he ſoars above himſelf; and knowing that he came forth from God as from his Principle, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to return thither as to his ultimate end.</p>
                  <p>Though this be a very noble Allyance, yet we may ſay, it relates not to God in his Perſons, but in his Eſſence: For all the perfections Man received in his Creation, are but the droppings of the perfections of God: His Power expreſſeth that of his Creator; his Liberty is an emanation of that Being which is as free as it is neceſſary; his Reaſon is a product of the firſt primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reaſon; and all the other qualities that raiſe him above the reſt of Creatures, are rather images of the Unity of God, then of the Plurality of his Perſons.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115672:24"/>who at the moment of their Nativity have the honour to be allyed to all the Perſons of the Trinity: The Son loves them as his Brethren, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adopts them as his children, and the Holy Ghoſt quickens them as his Temples; therefore are they baptiſed in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt: Their Birth conſecrates them to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable myſtery; and from the time they receive the Being of Grace, they bear the Character of the Trinity.</p>

Now 'tis in Baptiſm that they obtain this honour; for albeit the Son of God is united to our Nature in the Myſtery of the Incarnation, and that there this eternal affinity was contracted, which death cannot diſſolve, we are not engraffed upon his Perſon but by Baptiſm; till we are bathed in this Laver, we have nothing but the miſeries of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any part in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Jeſus Chriſt.

From this time the Chriſtian is a new creature, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, without changing his nature he changeth his condition; though he hath yet but the ſeeds of glory, he hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the rights of a Son, and looks upon the Kingdom of heaven as his inheritance: The grace of Jeſus Chriſt blots out all his ſins; of a ſlave he becoms a child, of an object of wrath he becoms an object of love; and big with the merits of his Head, he hopes one day to reign with him in glory.</p>
                  <p>By a neceſſary conſequence he enters into an Allyance with the Father Everlaſting: not conſidering the meanneſs of his Extraction, nor the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of his Original, he treats with God as with his own Father; he makes uſe of thoſe amorous terms the Church puts in his mouth, and without loſing the reſpect of a ſervant, he enters into the liberty of a child. Grace faſtens ſo ſtrict a union betwixt them, that nothing but ſin can divide them;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115672:24"/>as it is an emanation of the divine Sonſhip, it is not a bare Adoption; and if it bear this name, 'tis becauſe we have no other to expreſſe its excellence by. But to comprehend rightly; this Allyance is as true as that which fleſh and blood entitles us to with our Fathers and Mothers: if this be founded in Nature, that is founded in Grace; if this be ſenſible, that is ſpiritual; if this be cloſe, that is more intimate; neither is the quality of children in Chriſtians a meer denomination, as 'tis in thoſe that humanely are adopted. We are the images of our Father, in the donation of Grace we participate of his nature; and as it is true according to the ſaying of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that <hi>by grace we are God's;</hi> ſo is it certain, that by the ſame grace we are the children of God. "All the trouble in this Alliance, is, that it depends upon our Liberty for its preſervation; we have the power to diſſolve it, there needs but one act of our will to break the Aſſociation; and though the chains that entertain it are ſtronger and more precious then thoſe of Diamond, one mortall ſin is able to daſh them all in pieces; there is nothing but Glory that unites us inſeparably with God; as long as we live upon the earth we are divided between hope and fear, and if the greatneſs of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance makes us joyful, it's frailty cauſeth us to be apprehenſive and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: As long as it laſts, it protects us from all diſaſters, we have nothing to be afraid of but our own weakneſs; and provided we remain true to Grace, we may promiſe our ſelves victory over our greateſt enemies." God watcheth over us as over the members of his Son, he hath a care of our Intereſts, he bleſſeth all our deſignes, he makes the hatred of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſerviceable to our ſalvation; and ſpite of the fury of all Divels that tempt us, and the rage of all Tyrants that perſecute us, he at laſt brings us happily to Glory.</p>
                  <p>But that which I finde moſt admirable in this Allyance, is, that in ſome ſort it makes us enter upon the rights of a Father over his Son Jeſus Chriſt: for we

                  <p>This advantage is not ſo peculiarly theirs, that it is not common to them with the faithful; Every Chriſtian may conceive Jeſus Chriſt in his own ſoul, and bring him forth in others, he may be both Father and Mother; and the Son of God teacheth us, that ſo holy an Allyance is contracted by an humble obedience: He that doth the will of his Father, becomes his Mother, he that preacheth by his good example becomes his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and every Chriſtian may boaſt he returns that to Jeſus Chriſt he received from him in his Baptiſm. But certainly, we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is no perſon that more honourably poſſeſſeth this advantage, then the bleſſed Virgin: ſhe is the Mother of the Son of God in ſo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt a manner, that ſhe comes neer that of his Eternal Father; 'tis the nobleſt copy of that divine Original; neither is there any creature to whom God hath more largely communicated his fecundity: He takes pleaſure to ſee himſelf imitated by the Virgin, and to obſerve in the perſon of <hi>Mary</hi> the properties of his divine Hypoſtaſis: He begot his Son of his ſubſtance, and <hi>Mary</hi> of her bloud; He conceived his Word in his boſom, and <hi>Mary</hi> in her womb; He produced him by a vertue that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes his Perſon in the Trinity, and <hi>Mary</hi> brings him forth by the ſame vertue communicated to her in the moment of the Incarnation; He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth him by the knowledge of his Greatneſs, and <hi>Mary</hi> by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her Nothingneſs. Finally, the Father begetteth his Son equall to himſelf,

Thus the Eternal Father hath nothing ſo proper, that he communicates not to Chriſtians; the Allyance he contracts with them is ſo ſtrict, that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him they are all the fathers of the ſame Son; and we may ſay, 'twas drawn out of that communication, ſeeing he reſerves not that very quality that diſtinguiſheth him from his own naturall Son.</p>
                  <p>As the holy Spirit is the ſacred bond uniting all theſe divine Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, he alſo is pleaſed to aſſociate himſelf with the Chriſtians, and entertains ſo firm a union with them, that he is as well their Spirit, as that of the Father and the Son: for he is ſhed abroad in our hearts by charity; he erects his Throne in our hearts, he quickens us by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, leads us by his motions, illuminates us by his light, and warms us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115672:25"/>by his heat. He is ſo well blended with us, that he is more the Principle of our actions, then we our ſelves: If we pray, he furniſheth us with words and conceptions; he expreſſeth himſelf by our mouth, weeps with our eyes, works with our hands; and as if he were incarnate in each of us, he makes uſe of all our members to accompliſh his deſignes. This divine Spirit accommodates himſelf to all our affairs and conditions; he acts diverſly in the faithfull, and as the ſoul, diffuſed over all the body, ſees with the eys, works with the hands, hears with the ears; ſo he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Apoſtles, ſuffers in the Martyrs, inſtructeth in the Doctors, and in his adorable Unity produceth an acceptable Diverſity of operations and effects: His infinite charity obligeth him to intermeddle with our affairs; he comforts the miſerable without troubling his own happineſs, he ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the weak, and makes Maids and Children triumph in the infirmity of their Age and Sex, he teacheth the ignorant, and this Divine Maſter diſtils Truth into the Underſtanding without the mediation of the Senſes. Finally, he is the Spirit of the Church, the bond of the faithful, the love of Chriſtians, the mutuall gift of Men to God, and of God to Men.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſurpaſſeth all belief, He is ſo abſolutely in our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, that the faithfull communicate him to others: The Prieſts are not onely the Miniſters, but the Principles thereof, they produce him by their word, as they do Jeſus Chriſt; neither are there any Sacraments in the Church which are not ſo many channels by which they powre forth the Holy Ghoſt into the ſouls of Chriſtians. Nay, many times they that have him not themſelves impart him to others; being poor, they make others rich; and having not the grace, they notwithſtanding communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſource; for though they loſe their ſanctity, they loſe not their power; and as it is founded in their Character, which can never be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated, they have alwayes the right to give the Holy Ghoſt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſins. But becauſe I intend to make a particular Treatiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Chriſtian, I ſhall reſerve my larger Diſcourſe of the Allyances we have with him, for that place; and conclude the preſent ſubject with thoſe words of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>FOraſmuch as Effects are the images of their Cauſes, we never judge better of the power of theſe, then by the greatneſs of thoſe: A great Effect leads alwayes on to a great Cauſe, and this Maxime is as true in Grace as in Nature. For if God ſometime make uſe of a weak Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to produce a miracle,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aliud eſt enim baptizare per miniſterium, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud per poteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; Baptiſma enim tale eſt qualis eſt ille in cujus poteſtate datur: no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> qualis eſt ille per cujus miniſterium da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> Aug. Tr. 5. in Joann.</note> he raiſeth the puiſſance thereof, and by himſelf ſupplyes what infirmity would ſink under. Thence it comes to paſs, that the Fathers of the Church attribute to Jeſus Chriſt all the effects of Baptiſm, teaching us, that 'tis neither the vertue of the Water, nor the merit of the Miniſter (though both are requiſite) that juſtifie the Chriſtian. God reſerves to himſelf the glory to act in this Sacrament; He it is that baptiſeth by the hand of his ſervants, and without having reſpect to their deſerts, worketh grace by a Divel, as well as by an Angel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need not wonder that ſo common an element produceth ſuch rare effects, ſeeing 'tis in his hands who of nothing was able to create all things. Theſe effects are almoſt infinite, their number aſwell as their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs aſtoniſh us; and to obſerve them well, we had need be illuminated by his light whoſe works they are.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nolite contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtare Spiritum ſanctum, in quo ſignati eſtis.</hi> Epheſ. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The moſt part of Divines are of opinion, that the impreſſion of the character is the firſt effect: for he that is baptiſed wears the Livery of his Soveraigne, he is marked with his Seale, and from the time of his Baptiſm there is formed in the eſſence of his ſoul a Character that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Time nor Eternity can blot out: He carries it with him to heaven for his glory, into hell for his confuſion; and that which was a mark of his allyance with God, becoms a mark of his rebellion againſt God. Men make their ſlaves wear upon their garments viſible Badges of their vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallage, and there are ſome ſo cruel as to ſtigmatize their very faces: The Divel (who is Gods Ape) engraves his Character upon the bodies of thoſe miſerable wretches that ſerve him; and if we beleeve the report of the Magicians, and the experience of the Judges that have examined them, there are not any Witches who bear not the ſhamefull marks of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable ſervitude. This proud Spirit imitates his Soveraign as far as his weakneſſe will give him leave, and he is raviſhed that the creature who hath given himſelf to him, witneſſeth his fidelity by an external and viſible impreſſe: ſince he cannot act in the ſouls of men, he is content to act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their bodies; and he is ſatisfied, when upon the works of the Creator may be ſeen ſome characters of his Tyranny. But God who is abſolute in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:115672:26"/>his State, acts upon the ſouls aſwell as upon the bodies; and at the ſame time that the Miniſters ſprinkle the water of Baptiſme upon the body of the Neophytes, he imprints an eternall character in their ſouls.</p>
                  <p>This firſt effect is followed with another, to wit, the Infuſion of Grace: for aſſoon as the words that conſecrate us are pronounced, the holy Spirit enters into our hearts, and there produceth that divine quality which renders us the children of God. We know not whether it be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in all thoſe that are baptiſed: Some are of opinion, that the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of thoſe that are at age augments or diminiſheth it, and according as they have more or leſſe actuall love, they receive more or leſſe habituall Grace. Some others paſs the ſame judgment upon Infants, and are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the deſigne of God upon their ſouls makes the difference of their Graces; and that thoſe who are deſtin'd to the higheſt degrees of Glory, receive alſo at their baptiſm a higher degree of Grace. This que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion being not yet reſolved, every one may abound in his own ſenſe, though it ſeem, that as every man equally ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> every Chriſtian is equally regenerated in Jeſus Chriſt. But I conceive our Fall and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration are two Abyſſes that cannot be ſounded; and that the example alledged for confirmation of the firſt, is as much conceal'd, as the Truth they would thence elicite and extract. Therefore, not confining our ſelves to any one of theſe opinions, 'tis better to confeſs our ignorance, and acknowledge there are ſecrets in the order of Grace, aſwell as in that of Nature, which the ſpirit of man can by no means diſcover.</p>
                  <p>The third Effect of Baptiſm is the reſtitution of the Innocence we loſt in Paradiſe: Every one explains it according to the conceit he hath of it; and there are ſtore of Divines who imagine that man by the vertue of Baptiſm, re-enters into all the advantages of <hi>Adam;</hi> that his will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its Perfect freedom, his underſtanding its light, and every faculty of the ſoul is re-eſtabliſhed in its primitive vigour and activity. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, experience gives this opinion ſufficiently the lye, ſeeing every day the faithful to their coſt finde that their will is a ſlave to concupiſcence, and if the aſſiſtance of Jeſus Chriſt give them not the maſtery, there is no temptation but would engage them in a ſin. Indeed, though we ſhould affirm, that habitual grace reſtores us with advantage what-ever <hi>Adam</hi> deſpoyl'd us of; yet muſt we acknowledge that concupiſcence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in thoſe that are baptiſed, making havock in their ſouls aſwell as in their bodies; that it weakens their wills, becauſe it divides them; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcures their underſtandings, becauſe it ſheds darkneſs over them; troubles their reſt, becauſe it ſtirs up ſeditions in their perſon, which end not but with their life: Let us ſay then that this innocency is nothing but a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from ſin, which flowing from grace, cauſeth that the diſorders of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence render us not guilty, and that there muſt be an act of the will to occaſion the loſs of that which grace hath endued us with. This binds us ſo powerfully to Jeſus Chriſt, that we find more ſtrength in him then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115672:27"/>in <hi>Adam,</hi> and are more ſecure in our Baniſhment then we had been in the earthly Paradiſe. But this Innocence, though never ſo ſubſtantial, is not quiet, its conflicts make up the beſt part of its glory, its enemies prepare triumphs for it; and 'tis always arm'd, becauſe 'tis well aſſured Heaven cannot be gain'd now but by violence.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Effect of Baptiſm is the weakening of our concupiſcence: For though it remain in the baptized for their exerciſe, it loſeth much of its vigour, being left an orphan, in reſpect of the father that gave it life, it droops and languiſheth; and ſeparated from ſin, it gives us no aſſaults but ſuch as we may eaſily defend our ſelves from. The grace that aſſiſts us is more potent then the adverſary that ſets upon us: and 'tis upon this occaſion that we may ſay, Stronger are they that are on our ſide, then thoſe that are againſt us. A man muſt needs play the coward, to ſuffer himſelf to be overcome in a combat where the victory depends upon his own will animated with Grace. If we want help, we may pray for it; and the Chriſtian hath this comfort, to know that his own conſent is neceſſary to his undoing. True it is, inaſmuch as he is not ignorant that his victory is affix'd to Grace, and that Grace is not ſo due unto him, as that it may not be juſtly refuſed him, he hath ſtill reaſon to fear; and diſtruſting his own ſtrength, is obliged to have recourſe to the mercy of his divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
                  <p>Though all Chriſtians are perſecuted by concupiſcence,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cecidit primus homo, &amp; omnes qui de illo nati ſunt, de illo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerunt concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentiam carnis.</hi> Aug. Tract. 5. in Joann.</note> yet is it not certainly known whether it be equall in all; for it is ſo impotent in ſome, it ſeems utterly extinct; all their inclinations are ſo good, we have great reaſon to beleeve that Grace is rather the Principle of their actions, then corrupted Nature; and having had a greater ſhare in Jeſus Chriſt at their Baptiſm, they have leſſe of <hi>Adam</hi> then others of his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Nothing pleaſeth them but vertue, ſin appears with no ſhape but that of horrour; and whether it be that Grace hath weakened Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, or fortified Nature, they have none but holy deſires, and juſt and upright hopes: Others, on the contrary, have ſo many bad inclinations, that Baptiſm ſeems not to have regenerated them; <hi>Adam</hi> appears more in their actions and in their words then Jeſus Chriſt, the old man is more thriving and operative in their perſons then the new; and did not faith inſtruct us, that the Sacraments infallibly produce their effects, we ſhould with reaſon doubt, whether they had received that of Baptiſme or no. Theſe two differences can proceed from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but from thoſe two Principles which we are equally ignorant of, to wit, whether ſome men have more tranſgreſſed in <hi>Adam,</hi> or more merited in Jeſus Chriſt then others have; unleſſe we will lay all the blame and misfortune of the later upon their own conſtitution, or upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of their Parents, who many times make them undergo the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their debauches.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe internall Effects may be added a great number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115672:27"/>ones, which makes us greatly admire the power of Baptiſm. For by the vertue of this Sacrament the Chriſtian is freed from the ſlavery of Satan, he changeth his Maſter, as he changeth his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Hell is ſhut againſt him, Heaven is opened to him; the Angels look upon him as one of their Companions; and ſeeing in his ſoul the Mark of their Soveraign, they are very tender and reſpective of his Grace and Priviledges. Circumciſion had not this advantage; for if it diſtinguiſhed a child from an Infidel, enroll'd him in the number of the Iſraelites, and by the belief of his Parents ſhed forth faith into his ſoul; yet all Divines are of opinion, that it gave him no entrance into Heaven, and that dying in that ſtate, they went down into <hi>Limbo,</hi> the skirts and fringes of perdition: The heavens were not opened till the Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt; He it was that delivered our Fathers from their Captivity; and that he might triumph over Hell, aſwell as over Earth, made them partakers of his happineſs. But to give us a clearer apprehenſion of the right we have to Glory by Baptiſm,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>From this advantage there ariſeth another which greatly promoteth the Condition of Chriſtians: As they are ingrafted into the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, paſſing into a new order, they live under other lawes; and I can hardly believe that they are ſubject to that common Providence that rules over all men: For the illuſtration of this Truth, which may ſeem ſtrange becauſe it is new;

The Sun is the Throne where God ſits in ſtate, and where he acts with more force; 'Tis by meanes of this glorious Starre that he produceth the rareſt wonders of nature, and from the very moment that he drew all things out of nothing; he never appeares in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:115672:28"/>the production of any viſible Creatures, but he makes uſe of his light or heat. His Ecilpſes are dreadful to the Univerſe; he never ſuſpends his influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces but Nature ſuffers by it; and his courſe is ſo neceſſary to the conſtitution of the World, that a moment of reſt would be able to deſtroy it. Though this great body of Light have ſo abſolute a ſuperintendency over all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet doe I not believe that the Chriſtians hold of his Empire, though he enlighten them with his beams, warm them with his heat, and entertain their life with his motion: yet am I of opinion there is a particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that governs them:

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Luna per noctem.</hi> Pſal. 120.</note> that their occurrences are regulated by another ſun; neither is it in the power of Aſtrologers to diſcover the adventures of the faithfull. In that they are the members of Jeſus Chriſt, their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is affix'd to his perſon, their predeſtination is included in his, and we muſt underſtand the ſecrets of the Apocalypſe to divine their good or bad fortune. The divel himſelf, though never ſo ſubtil, cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this depth; if he have ſome conjectures for the future, they prove falſe in what concernes Chriſtians: the Grace that includes them, blindes him; and as the heavenly Light ſtrikes his ſpirit with obſcurity, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unacquainted with the wayes by which providence happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts them to their end. Therfore is it that Aſtrologers are never ſo much at a loſs, as when they pretend to judge of the fortune of Believers, by the rules of Aſtrology; they muſt dive into the minde of the eternal Father to underſtand his thoughts concerning the members of his Son, and leſs then to be admitted into his Cabinet where the unchangeable deſignes of his predeſtination are contrived, cannot inable them to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the ſmalleſt accidents of their life.</p>
                  <p>If the ſanctity of their Condition cloud them from the curioſity of Aſtrologers, it moreover protects them from the fury of Divels. For though theſe wretched ſpirits are called by ſcripture the Princes of the World, and the divine Juſtice ſuffers them to employ the Elements to content their fury: yet have they no power over the faithfull: All their rage turns to our profit, they are ſerviceable even while they perſecute: Their notable attempts, which teſtifie their power aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as their hatred, contribute greatly to our merit: The Divine Providence that regulates all their motions, makes uſe of them to our glory; and wee learn by experience, That nothing can hurt thoſe that love GOD, becauſe they are beloved of him. Thence ariſeth that profound tranquillity which Chriſtians enjoy; For as they know nothing happens in the world but according to the order and diſpoſall of their Soveraigne; that the fury of their Enemies is ſubject to his Providence, that the Divels execute his Will, that the Elements ſerve his Juſtice or his Mercy, they look upon all Accidents with a Holy indifferency; they embrace Life and Death, Honour and Diſhonour, Pleaſure and Pain with one and the ſame diſpoſition of ſpirit, and knowing very well that they are the members of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115672:28"/>they count it not ſtrange that his Father makes them climbe up to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by affronts, and to felicity by perſecution.</p>

He receives the ſinner into favour, ſignes him the pardon of his ſin, inveſts him with the merits of his Son, and promiſeth all things neceſſary for his preſervation in this new condition. I cannot imagine that this Peace is but a Truce, that there are any Chriſtians to whom God does not ſincerely and really remit originall ſin:

                  <p>There is ſome ſecret in Grace which yet we underſtand not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it comes to paſſe that without deſtroying the vertue of its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, we may reſiſt its operation; its charms perhaps are not ſo ſtrong, that they are alwaies inevitable, its powers rob us not of our liberty, and though it be very often victorious, yet it is ſometimes worſted: We have a miſerable power remaining in us to reſiſt its motions, and did it infallibly without any intermiſſion produce its effect, the Saints would not complain of their Infidelity. Whatever good we doe, bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the great Empire it hath over our wills, ſince it changeth them without compelling them, and a thouſand times more powerfull then elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it makes the ſinner act what he never had a mind to before; it knowes how to conquer our rebellion, and its charmes are ſo ſweetly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, that they maſter the moſt obſtinate, and ſubject the moſt rebellious. But the evill we doe, is an argument that our liberty may reſiſt it, that at all times it acts not with the like force; and if at its birth it work more vigorouſly, in its progreſs it growes more languiſhing and remiſſe, In this point conſiſts all the difficulty, this is the ſecret God hath not been willing to diſcover to us, 'tis the cauſe of our differences, and I am of opinion, this will never be underſtood till Jeſus Chriſt raiſe up ſome new light in his Church. I reverence Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> when he defends the party of grace, when he ſets it above mans freewill, when he ſtiles it victorious, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe its efficacy, affirmes that it infallibly produceth its effect: I am ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed when I read that great Doctor, how he makes man ſtoop to God, the will to grace, ſalvation to mercy. But withall I reſpect the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> teaching us that our liberty may reſiſt grace, that when it receives its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, it may reject them, and that in the very motion whereby 'tis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it may remain obſtinate and unmoveable; what ever is ſaid to reconcile theſe two opinions doth not at all ſatisfie me, and whatſoever anſwer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnd, I alwaies meet with difficulties great enough to perſwade me that earth is not the manſion of light, I honour S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and the Holy Sea,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115672:29"/>I ſubſcribe to the <hi>Anathema</hi>'s the Church hath thundered out againſt <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> &amp; <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> and as I believe that Sin hath not deſtroyed the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man, neither do I believe that Free-will ruines the power of Grace.</p>
                  <p>But to return where I left, I hold for certain, that God is never wanting to the Covenant he made with the Chriſtian in Baptiſm; that he never forſakes him, till he be forſaken by him; and that there is always ſome ſecret infidelity on mans part, that renders him unworthy of the aſſiſtance God would afford him: his grace is many times offered to the Chriſtian, though it be not due to him; and as he is conſtantly obliged to combat ſin, I conceive he hath continually ſome helps which he ſcarce ever fails of. If God make us ſenſible of our weakneſs, 'tis that he may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to have recourſe to his goodneſs: if he ſuffer us to fall, 'tis to puniſh us: and the withdrawing of his grace ſuppoſeth always ſome notable infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. When he pardons in Baptiſm, 'tis with as much Sincerity as Mercy: he doth not quicken a ſin that he hath made to die: he goes not to <hi>Adam</hi> to ſeek for motives to deſtroy a man that begins to revive in Jeſus Chriſt: and I verily believe he never refuſes grace to a Chriſtian for an offence he hath ſo ſolemnly pardoned.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt certainly confeſs that we obſerve not our promiſes with the ſame faithfulneſs, and that we are many times wanting to thoſe oaths and proteſtations we have made in Baptiſm. For the Chriſtian publikely vows that he doth renounce the devil, That he dies to himſelf, to live to Jeſus Chriſt, That he will be crucified with him; and as he takes his party, he is reſolved to fight his enemies. Let us examine theſe promiſes in particular, and ſee what they exact from us. Baptiſm in thoſe of age begins by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, in children by Exorciſm; it preſuppoſeth that they are poſſeſt with Devils; whom if they torment not as a Tyrant, they command as a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. If this Maxime be not true, the Ceremonies of Baptiſm muſt paſs for illuſions; and the Church, to amaze us with vain fears, increaſeth the miſery of our thraldom, to augment the benefit of our deliverance: when ſhe ſets us free from this ſhameful captivity, ſhe obligeth us to have no more commerce with the Evil ſpirit: and knowing that the World is his State, that it lives under his Laws, follows his Maximes, obeys his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhe gives us in charge to hate it: and to the end we may ſubmit to her injunctions, we promiſe, by the mouth of our Godfathers, to renounce the World as well as the Devil. But becauſe the grace that defaceth Sin deſtroys not Concupiſcence, but this monſter ſtill lives in our fleſh, ſtirs up diſorders there, makes parties, and raiſeth ſeditions; we engage moreover to weaken his Empire, to combat his deſignes, to check his motions. Thus the Chriſtians in their Baptiſm are obliged to a War, nay to Death; they muſt die, if they intend to live; they muſt fight, if they mean to overcome: and knowing that the New man is a ſouldier, they muſt conſider Life as a Combat, the Earth as the Pitched Field, and the Devil, the World and the Fleſh as irreconcileable Enemies.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115672:30"/>
                  <p>In the rere of theſe, marcheth a terrible Troop of ſins which Chriſtians are bound to grapple with and ſubdue. For the grace they have received in Baptiſm, differs much from that which <hi>Adam</hi> received in the ſtate of Innocence. His was quiet, and gave no alarms; it ſubjected the Soul to God, the Body to the Soul, and the Senſes to Reaſon; its commands were execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without the leaſt diſpute; it found no reſiſtance in its ſubjects: and as it commanded with Gentleneſs, it was obeyed with chearfulneſs. This of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is obliged to joyn Force with Sweetneſs: and as the moſt part of its ſubjects are rebels, they muſt be threatned, to reduce them to their duty. It commands always with the ſword in the hand: and knowing very well that when a people are up, Juſtice can execute nothing if it be not aſſiſted with force, it muſt be feared, that it may be obeyed. Hence it is that it calls in ſevere vertues to its aid, which make the Body afflict the Senſes, and ſwallow up the Paſſions. But uſe what endeavour it will, it findes by woful experience, that its ſubjects are ſo mutinous, that they cannot be brought in ſubjection: They are rather tired then overcome: and at the very inſtant they ſeem to ſubmit to Grace, they liſten to Concupiſcence; and taking new courage from this rebel-luſt, they ſet upon their Soveraign afreſh. Thus our whole life is a continual Warfare: we begin at our Baptiſm, and we end not till our Death. This is it that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo handſomely in his Treatiſe of the Deluge; where ſpeaking to the <hi>Neophytes,</hi> he ſays, You are baptized, you have the honour to bear the character of Jeſus Chriſt; you have been admitted to his Table, and his Fleſh hath ſerved for nouriſhment: Take notice how this new kinde of life engages you in a combat where you muſt grapple with the whole family of ſins: If you overcome Covetouſneſs, Luſt will ſet upon you; if you foil Luſt, Ambition ſteps in its place; and joyning craft to violence, endeavours to perſwade us that all his deſignes are reaſonable: If you maſter this combatant, Envie, Anger, Drunkenneſs, accompanied with their partiſans, will preſently draw into a body to deſtroy you. Therefore doth S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> compare the condition of newly-converted Chriſtians to that of the Jews when they went out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> They, ſaith he, were delivered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> theſe are delivered by Jeſus Chriſt; they paſſed thorow the red Sea, theſe paſs thorow Baptiſm; they ſaw all their enemies dead upon the ſhore, theſe ſee all their ſins drowned in the waters: But remember, my brethren, that the Jews having paſſed the Red-ſea, were not ſuddenly landed in <hi>Paleſtine:</hi> the wilderneſs and deſarts exerciſed their patience, hunger and thirſt oppreſſed them a long time, fiery ſerpents perſecuted them, and a thouſand ſtrange nations oppoſing their paſſage, made them ſtand to their arms to defend themſelves. Thus the Chriſtians ſpend their life in conflicts, and finde the world a horrid deſart, where a hundred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral monſters ſerve as trials of their courage, and exerciſes of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. They ſigh after their dear Country, they long to reign with Jeſus Chriſt; but diſciplined by theſe precedent Types and Figures, they are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115672:30"/>taught, that to arrive to his Triumphs, they muſt ſhare in his Combats. Therefore ought they not to think it ſtrange, though being brethren of Jeſus Chriſt, and children of their heavenly Father, they yet enjoy not their inheritance; and if, while they are on the earth treated like ſlaves or enemies, they ſtill feel the revolt of the Creatures, the perſecution of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the War of thoſe two parts whereof they are compoſed. Let us pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by theſe Examples, and remember that if Heaven be our Inheritance, 'tis alſo our Recompence; if we be Children, we are alſo Souldiers; and if God be Good enough to prevent our Deſerts, he is Juſt enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our Good Works.</p>

They act both together; and though ſin have divided them, yet does not Grace forbear to make uſe of Nature in its higheſt operations. Their deſignes are alike, onely they ſeek after God by diverſe ways: but Grace hath this advantage over Nature, that it never wanders. They have one and the ſame End, as they have one and the ſame Beginning; and when they ſeem to conteſt, their onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne is to make Man happie. Both of them are admirable in their Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Nature puts as many differences in mens Mindes, as in their Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and though all faces have the ſame parts, yet ſhe ranks them with ſo much artifice, that there appears a diverſity in their very likeneſs. Grace is not inferiour to Nature in this advantage; all its productions are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: and though the Saints are quickned with the ſame Spirit, the Church, recording their Panegyrick, inſtructs us that they are ſingular in their ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>But one of their greateſt reſemblances, is, that Nature is flowe in her operations: ſhe brings not her works to paſs without much labour and time: one grain of Corn coſts her a whole yeer; and ſhe needs the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Seaſons, to bring it to a perfect maturity. Flowers that are not ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as Fruits, ſtand her not in leſs time: and to give them their Colour and their Smell, Winter and Spring are requiſite. Grace is yet more ſlowe then Nature: for whether it finde reſiſtance in its deſignes, or labour in more difficult undertakings, it perfects not but in Eternity, what it begins
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115672:31"/>in Time: There remains ſomething ſtill to be reformed in the Creature: and whatever excellency of endeavour it beſtows upon the greateſt Saints, it continually meets with ſome diſorders to be regulated, ſome ſin to be corrected, ſome inclinations to be vanquiſhed. Thence it comes to paſs that in Baptiſm, where it gives life to the Chriſtian, it acts with ſo much weakneſs, that wiping away the ſtain of ſin, it leaves notwithſtanding Concupiſcence there ſtill. For though by the vertue of this Sacrament we become new creatures, that <hi>Adam</hi> dies, and <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> is born in us; yet are we but rude draughts, unpoliſhed works expecting their perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from time and travel: We are, ſaith one Apoſtle, but the <hi>embryo</hi> of a new creature; and we bear the denomination of Children by reaſon of our Weakneſs, as well as of our Innocence. The Principles of Chriſtian life are in our ſouls; we have the ſeeds of all vertues: but if we husband them not with great care, they are choak'd among the thorns of our evil inclinations.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding a truth that ſo much concerns our ſalvation, we muſt know that the grace of Baptiſm defaceth the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> inveſts us with the Innocence of Jeſus Chriſt; and giving us admittance into his rights, beſtoweth heaven upon us for our inheritance: of children of wrath which we were before,
<note place="margin">Salus hominis in Baptiſmate ſacta eſt, quia dimiſſum eſt peccatum quod ex parentibus traxit, vel quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid etiam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pric ante Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum peccavit.</note> we become children of mercy; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a true alliance with the holy Trinity, we renounce all affinity with fleſh and bloud. In this happy condition, we are no longer afraid of the juſt wrath of God; the thunders he threatens ſinners with, are no longer terrible to us; and living ſecurely under the ſhadow of Jeſus Chriſt, we know that the ſole ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> can no longer prejudice our ſalvation: we meditate with delight upon thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul, There is now no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We have the earneſt of our ſalvation in our ſelves; Grace is a pledge of glory: and remaining under the Conduct of the holy Spirit, we are ſure that under ſo good a guide we cannot miſcarry. But whatever hope our ſpirit flatters us with, we ceaſe not to have juſt apprehenſions of our fall: For though God never forſakes the ſinner, till the ſinner firſt forſake him; though he be faithfull in his promiſes, nor is ever wanting to the Treaty he made with us in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſme: Nevertheleſſe there remains in us a wretched faintneſſe, that ſo weakens us in temptation, that without a continued aſſiſtance of Grace, we cannot hope for victory. Concupiſcence always ſides with ſin; it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to revive what it firſt gave birth to; and over-ſpreading all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoul, and members of the body, it ſollicites all of them to riſe-againſt Grace: its Fruitfulneſs is equal to its Malice; it contains in it the ſeeds of all ſins: and when Temptation hatcheth them, there's not ſo much as one whereof man may not become guilty: As long as he carries about him this enemy, his ſalvation is in danger; he groans under its ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: and knowing that there wants but one meer act of the Will to be the midwife to ſin, he would willingly not be free, that he might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115672:31"/>criminal. For all Theologic confeſſeth that Concupiſcence is not taken away by Baptiſm, That it is left with the faithful to exerciſe them, That it continually provokes them to evil, That it contributes as often to their fall as to their glory; and if it increaſe their merit, it ſwells their danger. Though it be not a ſin in Chriſtians, it keeps them ſtill in breath; they are equally afraid of its ſmiles and of its frowns: and whether it flatter or frighten, they have ſtill reaſon to fear leſt it render then delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. In a word, Is it not a ſad condition for a man always to carry his enemy in his boſome; to be obliged to fight, without any aſſurance of getting the better; and to know that Grace with all its ſupplies may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble him, but never utterly defeat him? If Man account himſelf miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in Nature, becauſe he carries the principles of his death in himſelf; and that the oppoſition of the elements which make him live, muſt one day make him die: Is not the Chriſtian very unhappie in grace it ſelf, when he ſees how he bears about the ſource of ſin in his ſoul, That Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm ſets him not free from ſlavery, That Vertue engageth him to fight; and at the ſame time that Hope promiſeth him Victory, Fear appales him with the apprehenſion of a Defeat?</p>
                  <p>This vexation is redoubled by a troubleſome diviſion which his ſecond birth hath not compoſed. For the Chriſtian is unfortunately parted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Concupiſcence and Grace: he never ſights with his full ſtrength; and when he hath a minde to obey Charity, there is always ſome part of Himſelf that holds with his Enemy. The Fleſh always faceth the Spirit: Man is the Theatre of this dreadful combat; he cannot diſarm thoſe that trouble his reſt: though he ſometimes prevail over them, he fears leſt ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying their forces they triumph over their conquerour. 'Twas this inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable misfortune of the Chriſtian, that made S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſigh; 'twas this potent enemy that made him long for death: and ſuppoſing that 'twere better die then ſin, he deſired to loſe his Life, to preſerve his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity.</p>
                  <p>But admit the Chriſtian were delivered from Concupiſcence that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments him, and from Sedition that divides him; he is ſtill exerciſed by another trial which Baptiſm leaves him to grapple with: For he is ſubject to Illuſion; Errour, as well as Truth, ſteals into his Underſtanding: his giddy and unfaithful Senſes ſide more with Wickedneſs then with Grace: and theſe parties for the moſt part holding intelligence with the Devil, threaten him with Blindneſs and Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>'Tis by this gate that the devil ſurpriſeth the Will; 'tis by our eyes or by our ears that he ſeduceth us: and having theſe rebels always at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, we need not wonder if he gain ſo many victories againſt us. When he tempted our firſt father in Paradiſe, he ſet upon a place where he had no intelligence; the Senſes did not all aſſiſt him againſt the Intellectual faculty, nor Paſſions againſt Reaſon: Mans forces were united; and when his Will pronounced the definitive ſentence, he found as many miniſters to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115672:32"/>execute it, as he had Faculties. But now he hath ſcarce any members which are not inſtrumental to his enemy: his Grace, though never ſo powerful, ſtamps no faithfulneſs upon the Senſes, nor obedience upon the Paſſions: he hath no ſubmiſſion but by violence; and reigning in a ſtate where Concupiſcence lives ſtill, he meets with more rebels then ſubjects. All his ſtability conſiſts in Grace: inſtructed by the defeat of <hi>Adam,</hi> he has recourſe to his divine Redeemer; and knowing very well that his forces are weakned by ſin, he findes no better expedient to vanquiſh his enemy, then to confeſs his impotency.

                  <p>But whatever artifice our Humility makes uſe of to defend it ſelf, yet muſt we confeſs that 'tis an extreme affliction to know that the devil that tempts us can trouble our Imagination, and make a part of our ſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to his malice: For in concluſion, Concupiſcence is a truſty miniſter which executes all his commands, ſets all the Paſſions in a commotion in behalf of him, debaucheth all the Senſes to ſerve him; and carrying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order into the inmoſt receſſes of the Soul, undertakes to make the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the Will ſtoop to his lure. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acknowledged this miſery; and confeſſeth, that though the body were ſanctified by Baptiſm, it had not loſt its corruption; that in the language of Scripture it lay heavie upon the ſoul, diſpoſing it to ſin. Nay, the ſoul it ſelf, though it have a greater ſhare in grace then the body, is nevertheleſs engaged in ſelf-love: Though in Baptiſm it received remiſſion of all ſins, yet its bad inclinations are not obliterated in a moment: nor do the firſt-fruits of Grace produce Vertues, if they be not husbanded with much care and diligence: the New man muſt increaſe daily, if he intend to ruine the Old; and diſmantle the body of Sin, if he will eſtabliſh the Spirit of Grace. For 'tis an errour, ſaith that great Saint, for a man to perſwade himſelf, that from the very moment that a Chriſtian is baptized, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the old man are quite waſhed away: his renovation indeed begins by the remiſſion of ſins; but it cannot arrive to perfection, but as he goes on in vertue, and taſtes thoſe ſpiritual delights which ſerve as nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment to the new life. They therefore are much deceived, who anchor their hope upon their Character; who think, to be a Chriſtian, is title enough to Salvation; and never conſidering that they have onely the ſeeds of Chriſtianity, labour not to make them fructifie by good works: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever neglects this care, cannot preſerve his grace any long time; and he that reſiſts not Temptation which remains after ſin, is in great danger to be ſpeedily deprived of the Innocence of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe internal evils which ſeize us, may be added thoſe external ones which ſurround us: for if Regeneration reform not the diſorders of our ſoul nor of our body, it never aſſwageth the perſecution of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:115672:32"/>Though we be juſtified by Baptiſm, we are not inſtated in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive advantages: The Curſe iſſued out againſt the Creatures, is not taken away by Grace; and as we experience revolts in our perſon, we reſent them alſo in our ſtate. The Earth hath not recovered her former fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it brings forth thorns to this day to puniſh us; it nouriſheth mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that make war againſt us; it rends aſunder in gaping chaſms to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low us up; and levels mountains to overwhelm us. Every Element mindes us of our miſery: they make no difference between an Infidel and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Though the Angels reſpect their character, Creatures deſpiſe it, or know it not. The Sea drowns Our Veſſels, as well as thoſe of the Turks. To be reconciled with God, makes us not friends with the Windes: a man muſt be a Saint that commands the Waves: And if together with our Charity, we have not alſo the gift of Miracles, we know not how to calm the Sea, nor to appeaſe Tempeſts. The Fire ſpares not all Innocents; it hath burnt Martyrs who had no leſs faith then the Three Children that walk'd untouch'd in the midſt of the fiery furnace: it ſometimes blends it ſelf with Thunder, and, being blinde, ſtrikes the Juſt as often as the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Church canonizeth ſome Saints, which that element hath reduced to Powder: and becauſe ſhe knows that the ſentence of our death ſpeaks of duſt and aſhes, ſhe wonders not if Thunder have the ſame operation upon ſome Saints, which Time is deſigned to have upon All men.</p>
                  <p>Finally, all the Elements teach us that we are Miſerable, though we be not Criminal: Baptiſm, that delivers us from Sin, frees us not from Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God will have the World perſecute us, that we may hate it: he hath ordained the place of our baniſhment to be troubleſome, leſt it ſhould make us forget our Country. This is the Advantage we draw from our Evil, the Comfort we retain in our Miſeries: and 'tis enough to make us ſtoop with all humility to the Juſtice of God, inaſmuch as we know that our Puniſhment may as well be ſerviceable to our own Salvation, as to his Glory.</p>

T'is from this happy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the ſacred Hiſtorians begin the Annals of our Mother, and then it was that the Apoſtles her Fathers, and her Children, cured of their ignorance and infirmity, prepared themſelves for the conqueſt of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and the couverſion of Infidels. The ſame ſpirit that inſpired them with life, inſpired them with courage for ſo generous a deſigne, and hell trembled with amazement when it beheld twelve fiſhermen, and ſeventy Peaſants, reſolved to loſe their lives, or to work the downfall of Infidelity: Their ſtrength triumphed over the power of Kings, their ſimplicity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the prudence of Politicians; their ignorance convinced the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of Philoſophers; and their diſcourſe, void of all rhetoricall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perſwaded the mindes of Oratours.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Prodigies are very apt to beget wonder; but when we conſider that the Apoſtles ſerved as interpreters to the holy Ghoſt, that he ſpake with their mouthes, and that he reſided in their hearts, we ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it ſtrange, that he that ſubdued Egypt with an army of flies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the world by a few fiſhermen.

                  <p>I ſee nothing more venerable and auguſt in the infancy of the Church, then the firſt Councell held in the City of Jeruſalem, to decide a matter that might ſeparate the Jews from the Gentiles; It was not convened with ſo much pomp as others have been; there appeared not the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Chriſtian Princes, becauſe the whole Church was included within
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115672:35"/>the walls of one onely City; there were no Philoſophers who made uſe of the vanity of their Sciences to impede the progreſſe of the truth of the Goſpel; there were no ſtrange Nations, becauſe all the beleevers were of one Countrey; the epitome of the Univerſe was not ſeen in one Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe the Church had not yet diſplayed her banner, neither in Europe, nor Africa: But there might be ſeen the Lieutenant of Jeſus Chriſt, with a zeal worthy of his charge; there was the Biſhop of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, who was to water with his blood the Church that he had built by his example, and inſtructed by his ſermons; there might you ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the Gentiles take the intereſt of the people he had newly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prove by his reaſons that the Goſpel being the accompliſhment of the Law, they were not to make that live again which Jeſus Chriſt had crucified with himſelf upon the Croſſe.</p>
                  <p>But of all the circumſtances that give an excellency to this Councell above all others, I am raviſhed with none ſo much as with that great aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unſhaken confidence the Apoſtles begin their deciſions withall; For they acquaint us that they were the Organs of the holy Ghoſt; that he that reſided in their hearts, expreſſed himſelf by their mouthes; that he pronounced his Oracles in their words, and confirming all they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, he had no other ſence but theirs. <hi>Viſum eſt ſpiritui ſancto &amp; nobis.

                  <p>THough there is not any part in a mans body uſeleſs or unprofitable, yet Natural Philoſophy acknowledgeth the Heart and the Head for the two principal. The Head is placed in the higheſt and moſt eminent ſeat, as the Soveraign, having all the Senſes as ſo many faithful miniſters; gives orders aad ſheds influences thorow the whole body of the State: thence every part receives Senſe and Motion: and no ſooner is there any obſtruction that hinders the commerce of the Head with the reſt of the Members, but they remain ſtupied or benummed. The Heart is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Head in dignity: And we may affirm the Body an Empire that obeys two Soveraigns, without the inconvenience of a Schiſm; and takes Law from two abſolute Potentates, without dividing their Royalty. For the Heart reſides in the midſt of the Body, as a King in his Kingdom, conveys the Spirits thorow the Arteries, diſpenſeth Life to all his Subjects: ſo extremely ſenſible of the Publike good, that not the leaſt diſorder can ariſe, but he gives notice of it by his irregular motion. As theſe two parts are the Nobleſt, ſo are they moſt United: their fair correſpondence ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the peace of the Body; their diviſion threatens its ruine: and when they no longer entertain a free communication, the State muſt neceſſarily periſh, without any hope of recovery.</p>
                  <p>If we may compare Great things with Small,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſiae Corporis Chriſtus eſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put, Spiritus ſanctus Cor.</hi> Thom.</note> we may ſay that the Church is a myſtical Body, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the Head, and the holy Ghoſt the Heart: They act diverſly, but to one and the ſame end: The one Guides this great Body, the other Quickens it; the one gives it Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other Life. As there is no misfortune that can divide them, the Body which they conſtitute is immortal; and whatever enemies ſet upon it, they ſhall never be able to prevail againſt it: all its Combats are attended with Victory: Death deſpoils it of no parts which Eternity reſtores not again: what it loſeth upon Earth, it recovers in Heaven; and by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie diſpenſation of Providence, findes Reſt in Perſecution, Life in Death, Glory in Shame. But as its greateſt advantage is to have the holy Ghoſt for its Heart, and the Son of God for its Head; let us ſpeak of the Firſt, till we ſhall have an opportunity to treat of the Second; and let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thoſe Graces and Bleſſings the Church receives from his guidance and direction.</p>
                  <p>Where, that we may not paſs the terms of our Compariſon, we ſay, that the holy Spirit being the Heart of this great Body, inanimates it by his Preſence, unites it by his Charity, guides it by his Light, and comforts
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115672:36"/>it by his Goodneſs. The Heart is the Nobleſt Seat of the Soul, the Throne where ſhe reigns, the Centre of her Principality, where ſhe keeps her chief reſidence; ſo that we may ſay, 'tis the Heart that inanimates the Body, and that part that gives life to all the reſt. Thence it comes to paſs, that, to expreſs the operations of the holy Spirit in the Church, we call him the Heart thereof; and not wronging his greatneſs, we make uſe of this Example to expreſs his Charity by. For 'tis an undoubted truth, That he inanimates the whole Church, That he is conveyed into all her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,

He is the Principle of her Operations, as the Author of her Life: She acts not but by His motions; and whatever She undertakes, 'tis by his Counſels, or his Inſpirations: He proſides in all Her Aſſemblies; She determines nothing but by His advice; and in Her Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels She pronounceth no Oracles which She hath not received from Him.

                  <p>If he inſtruct her in her doubts, he keeps her at unity, maugre thoſe rents and diviſions that threaten to diſtract her; entertaining that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable harmony amongſt the different parts whereof ſhe is compacted.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115672:36"/>all the care Polititians take to keep Peace in their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, there are a thouſand ſubjects of Diviſion which they cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Mens Intereſts are more different then their Conditions: the People are induſtrious to preſerve their Liberty, the Prince to enlarge his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; and Private men cannot endure the ruine of their Families, for the preſervation of the Publike. Though all theſe Diſorders were not able to ſowe Diviſion in a State, the diverſity of Opinions would effect it: For though every one mean well, yet all miniſters aim not at the ſame thing: the worſt Counſellors are many times moſt liſtned to; and thoſe that more reſpect the Fortune of the Prince then his Perſon, are moſt dangerous. But the Church is ſecured from all theſe dangers: though ſhe have many Miniſters, ſhe hath but one Counſellor: Gods Spirit is her Spirit: ſhe is never divided in her determinations: her embracing of an Opinion, makes it a Truth: and having conſulted him that governs her, all her Deciſions are Articles of Faith. She never erres in Councels: whatever ſhe pronounceth there, is infallible: and her children are no leſs obſervant of her words, then of thoſe of the Evangeliſts: She cannot be contradicted, without much raſhneſs: thoſe that deſert her Judgement, are involv'd in a Lye: and if thoſe who acquieſce in her boſome may haply be in the cloud of Ignorance, they cannot be in the ſnare of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The ſame Spirit that gives Authority to the Church, ſtamps Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon her children: ſo that there can be no falling out in a Body where Charity ſtiſles Schiſms, Light diſpels Darkneſs, and Power ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Revolts and Inſurrections.</p>
                  <p>But nothing ſo much magnifieth the Unity of the Church, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her not divided by the diſparity of Conditions; and that the ſame Spirit which unites all the Faithful, employs them about divers Offices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his deſignes, and their own inclinations. In this it is that the Church more reſembles a Natural body, and the Spirit the Heart that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animates it: For though the Heart be one, yet is it different in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it acts diverſly, according to the diverſity of the Members: It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it ſelf by the Mouth, guides it ſelf with the Eyes, defends it ſelf with the Hands; and making every part ſerviceable according to its power, it preſerves the Publike good, without intereſſing the Private. Thus one and the ſame Spirit cauſeth a thouſand different effects in the Church: it ſpeaks by the mouth of Prophets, enlightens their underſtandings, informs them of ſecrets to come; and violating the method of Time, recals things paſt, and makes futurities preſent. He it was that wrote the Hiſtory of the Son of God, before he was born of his mother: he it was that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Truths in Figures, his Light in Shadows, and the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant actions of his life, by thoſe of the Patriarchs. The ſame Spirit that ſpake by the mouth of the Prophets, ſpake by that of the Apoſtles: he was their Maſter, after the Aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt into heaven: he inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in thoſe Myſteries they were yet ignorant of; and making them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115672:37"/>capable in a moment, taught them without the tedious expence of labour and delay what they were ſuddenly to preach to Infidels.</p>
                  <p>To facilate this deſign, he gave them the gift of Tongues; and working a Miracle incredible to reaſon, he inſpired them with words which the whole World underſtood, that all Nations might obey them. 'Twas a prodigy that ſurpriz'd men,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Per linguas di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſas dividi meruit genus humanum; Ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae contulit unitate, ut quod diſcordia diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipaverat col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeret charitas.</hi> Aug. ſer. 3. de Pentecoſt.</note> when God (intending to ſtop the progreſſe of that proud Tower, the aſpiring Poſterity of <hi>Noah</hi> rayſ'd to get them a Name) confounded their Language, and ſcattered the people by the diviſion of their Dialects: But it was a far greater wonder, when the Holy Ghoſt to unite all Nations, honoured the Apoſtles with the gift of Tongues, and made one man ſpeak the Language of the Univerſe, that the Goſpel might be preached without an Interpreter through all the Provinces of the World: And we muſt confeſſe, the Church was never more glorious then when conſiſting but of one people, it already ſpake the Language of all Countreys, and proclaimed by this Miracle, that her Conqueſts were to have no bounds, but thoſe of the Univerſe. To this day ſhe enjoyes this Priviledge, but with leſſe ſplendour; ſhe ſpeaks all Languages, becauſe ſhe poſſeſſeth ſome of all people; ſhe hath that in her progreſſe, which was conferred upon her at her birth; and ſhe owns that amongſt all the Faithfull,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Loquor omnibus linguis quia in co ſum Chriſti corpore, hoc eſt, in Eccleſia quae loquitur jam omnibus lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis.</hi> Aug. in pſal. 54.</note> which heretofore was eminent in every one of the Apoſtles. Therefore ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is the gift of Tongues now ſuperfluous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church having over-ſpread all the Earth, ſhe finds in the meaneſt of her Diſciples, what was conſin'd heretofore to the Colledge of her Maſters; and ſhe may boaſt ſhe hath loſt nothing of her antient Priviledges, becauſe the goods of a Body being common among the Members, ſhe hath no children that ſpeak not all ſort of Tongues by the mouth of their brethren.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe ſpeech, without the effect, is but a dead letter; the ſame Spirit that gave the Church the gift of Tongues, gave her alſo the power of working Miracles; ſhe hath ſubjects to whom nothing is impoſſible; Nature ſubmits to their orders; Faith that inanimates them, makes them abſolute in the ſtate of their Soveraign: The Sun ſtands ſtill in the midſt of his Courſe to doe homage to their words; the Sea becomes firm under their feet, and the Earth trembles under thoſe of their Enemies; and they oblige that common Mother to make a ſepulcher of her Womb to ſwallow them up alive. Indeed, this favour that exalts them ſo high, is tranſient to humble them;
<note place="margin">

Tho.</note> their will is not the rule, but the motion of the Holy Ghoſt; they act not, but when hee acts with them; they work miracles, when they receive the power from him; and aſſoon as ever he leaves them, they return to their former inability. Miracles coſt them prayers and teares; they acknowledge their dependance, even whilſt they exerciſe their Empire; and whilſt all people look upon them as Gods, they finde themſelvs oblig'd to confeſſe that they are nothing but mear Creatures. Is it not a wonder, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> drives away Divels, heals the ſick, and yet by his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115672:37"/>prayers cannot deliver either himſelf from that Divel, or that malady, which exerciſed his humility as much as his patience?</p>
                  <p>Finally, this Spirit that acted ſo powerfully by the hands of the Apoſtles, eſtabliſhing the Goſpel no leſſe by their miracles then by their words, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified them in perſecutions, and gave them courage at the ſame time to triumph over grief and pleaſure too. For as the Tyrants employd ſubtilty and violence, power and policy to vanquiſh the Martyrs, making uſe of threats and promiſes to aſtoniſh or ſeduce the Apoſtles, it was requiſite that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould inſpire them with continence and ſtrength; and that Grace ſerving them inſtead of a Sword and Buckler, gain'd them as many Victories as they were bid Battels. His power never appeared more glorious then upon this occaſion;
<note place="margin">

In the meane time, he that ſhall conſider theſe effects in their primitive cauſe, will confeſſe that one and the ſame ſpirit hath produced them; and that as he inanimates the Church by his preſence, ſo by his aſſiſtance he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates the underſtanding of Tongues, the knowledge of things to come, the power of Miracles, and the victory over torments. Wherefore the Church knowing very well that ſhe owes all to the Holy Spirit,

                  <head>The Third DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Holy Spirit is in ſome ſort the ſame to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that hee is to the Father and the Son from all Eternity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe alliance that the Eternall Word hath contracted with men, is the ſource and originall of that which the Father and the Holy Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract with the ſame Creatures. The Father loves us as his children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are the brethren of his only Son. Heaven is as well our inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as our recompence; and the quality of mercenaries or ſouldiers which we beare, is no barre to that of children and heirs: The Holy Spirit
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115672:38"/>hath an influence alſo upon our ſouls by charity; hee rears an altar in our hearts, and of the members of our body, he vouchſafes to make living Temples. But as his infinite love hath no bounds, his communications are much aforehand; and by an exceſſe of goodneſſe, he was pleaſed to bee in time to the faithfull, what he is in the Trinity to the Father and his only Sonne.</p>
                  <p>The whole Scripture teacheth us that the Holy Spirit is a ſacred bond, uniting the Father and the Son from all Eternity: The Church which is very wel-ſighted in theſe profound Myſteries,
<note place="margin">Nexus amoris quo conjungitur Pater cum filio &amp; filius cum Patre.</note> cals him the <hi>True-loves-Knot:</hi> The concluſion of her prayers, clearly inſtruct us that the Father and the Son reign together in the unity of the Spirit. Admit they were not one and the ſame Thing by their Eſſence, they would be one and the ſame Principle by the Holy Spirit; ſince all Theologie knowes very well that the Father and the Son are admirably united together to produce him: Therefore hath he received a name that perfectly expreſſeth his ineffable proceſſion;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Charitas quae pater diligit filium &amp; fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us patre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, quae eſt Spiritus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, ineffabilem communionem demonſtrat.</hi> Aug. de Trini.</note> for being the production of the Father and the Son, he bears a name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to both; and he is cal'd the Spirit, becauſe the Father and the Sonne call him ſo in Scripture. Now this Spirit is the ſacred Bond which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns all Chriſtians together; he is not onely the ſoul, but the unity; and he it is, who by admirable and ſecret Tyes, entertaines a faire cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence between all the parts of this great body: The diffence of their conditions, the contrariety of their humours, the diverſity of their deſigns, hinders not the Holy Spirit from uniting them together; nor that he that is the agreement of the Father and the Son, be alſo the peace and agreement of the faithfull. He it is, that decided the differences between the Jewes and the Gentiles; he it is, who breaking down the partition Wall, hath made of them one building; he it is, who perfecting the deſign of Jeſus Chriſt, hath happily taken out of the way all obſtacles that impeded the unity of the Church; and he it is, who equalling the poor with the rich, the freeman with the ſlave, the learned with the ignorant, hath framed that wonderfull body, the moſt perfect Image of the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Therefore muſt we acknowledge that all thoſe figures that repreſent to us the perſon of the holy Ghoſt, abundantly bear witneſſe that his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall work is unity. For ſometimes he is called Fire, becauſe that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment combines metalls in melting them, and of two different ſubſtances makes a third, which is neither one nor the other, but rather both: Sometimes he is called Water, becauſe he gives conſiſtency to the earth, watering it by ſecret veins, and of a fluid ſand makes a ſolid heap, which ſerves for the foundation and centre of the whole Univerſe; Therefore is it that the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles never ſpeaks of unity,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Solliciti ſervare unitatem ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus in vinculo pacis.</hi> Epiſt.</note> but he mentions the holy Ghoſt, as the ſource and fountain of it: As often as he recommends peace to the faithfull, he wiſheth them him that recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciles men unto God, by the remiſſion of ſin that ſeparates them aſunder. Neither hath charity, which is the principall effect of this ever to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115672:38"/>Spirit, any more worthy employment, then to unite Chriſtians toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after he hath united them with the Trinity.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Alliance that he contracts with us, is, that he becomes the gift of God to men, as he is the gift of the Father to the Son, and of the Son to the Father back again. If we beleeve prophane Philoſophy, Love is not onely the firſt production, but the firſt profuſion of the will; This faculty is liberall, aſſoon as it is amorous, and parting with its love, it makes a donation of whatever holds of its Empire: Thence it comes to paſſe, that all Lovers are prodigall, that they engage their liberty, ſtripping themſelves of their goods, and renouncing their own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, aſſoon as ever they begin to be affectionate: Now as the holy Spirit is the Love of the Father and the Son, ſo is He their mutuall gift; they give themſelves whatever they are in producing him; and it ſeems the Son renders to his Father, by the production of the Spirit, all that he received by his birth. Though we want termes to expreſſe the greatneſſe of theſe myſteries, Faith which ſupplies our impotency, ſteps in to perſwade us, that the holy Spirit is the uncreated Liberality of the Father, and of the Son, from all eternity; and tis the ſame faith that teacheth us, that the holy Ghoſt is alſo the gift of God to the Chriſtians, and that at the ſame time he entered into alliance with them, he beſtowed his love upon them, as a mark of his largeſſe; wherein I obſerve two or three things worthy of admiration. The firſt is, that God makes us a Preſent equall to himſelf,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dedit dona ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus, quale donum? Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſanctum; magna eſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem Dei miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia, donum dat aequale ſibi, quia donum ejus Spiritus ſanctus eſt.</hi> Aug. ſer. 44. de verb. Dom.</note> which the trueſt and moſt affectionate Lovers never do; for though gifts are the effects of love, they never equall it; and if the Lover makes not himſelf a ſlave to the perſon he loveth, he can offer no Preſent equivalent to his affection: Pearls and Diamonds are but weak expreſſions of his good will; whatever contents others, are but incentives to his deſires; he would be a Monarch, that he might beſtow a kingdom; and in that height of fortune, he would profeſſe, no prodigality can ſatisfie a Lover. But God, to whom nothing is impoſſible, hath in preſenting his love, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented a gift commenſurate to the greatneſſe of that beſt love he would expreſſe; that which he beſtows equalls himſelf, his Preſent is infinite; and when he tenders us the holy Ghoſt, he makes offer of a divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The ſecond excellency of this Preſent is, that it prevents our merit, becauſe it findes us in the ſtate of ſin; and did God conſult his juſtice, as much as his mercy, we ſhould appear the objects of his wrath rather then of his love: For he beſtows his Spirit upon his enemies, he ſheds his love abroad in the hearts of beleevers, and we receive this favour from him, when we deſerve nothing but chaſtiſements. The third excellency of this gift is, that it is the ſource of all others; for being the prime ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall donation, 'tis that from whence all the bounteous liberality of God iſſues and proceeds, who confers no benefit upon us, which bears not the image and ſuperſcription of this firſt and prime gratuity. Whatever comes from heaven, is a copy of the holy Spirit; riches are the expreſſes of his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115672:39"/>bounty; advantageous parts of ſoul or body, are the marks of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Graces and vertues are his immediate impreſſions; and in a few words to comprehend the priviledges of this Divine Offertory, we muſt ſay with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 'tis the <hi>Pandora</hi> thorow which all other gifts are beſtowed upon us. If the Angels deſcend from heaven to protect us, if the Sun enlightens us, if the Stars favour us, if the Earth nouriſh us, if the Trees ſhade us, if the Eternal Word leave the boſome of his Father to take upon him our miſeries, 'tis by the counſel and mediation of the holy Spirit: and this gift that raviſhed the Apoſtle who tells us of it, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an effect and conſequence of that primitive largeſs which is the cauſe of all others. Thence I infer, that when we receive any grace, we ought to look upward to the Holy Spirit; and acknowledging him the fountain of all bleſſings, profeſs our ſelves bound to render him the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>calves of our lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This favour would take away all hope of gratitude, did not the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſurpaſs it. For the Holy Spirit is the Love of the Faithful, as he is the Love of the Father, and of the Son. But to underſtand this truth, we muſt inform you, that the Word being begotten of the Father by the Underſtanding, is his onely Son; and that the Holy Ghoſt being produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Will, is his Love. The Father and the Son reciprocally love one another by this mutual charity; they finde their happineſs in this common dilection: and ſhould they ceaſe to love, they would ceaſe to be happie. Having a minde to exalt us to their happineſs, they raiſe us alſo to their love; and pouring forth charity into our ſouls, they make us capable of loving them. For God is ſo great, that he can neither be known but by his own Light, nor lov'd but by his own Love: the Holy Spirit muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten our Souls, warm our Wills; and by the purity of his flames, purge away the impurity of our affections: he transforms us into himſelf, to make us happie. This holy Love is a particular effect of the Holy Spirit: the beams that heat us, are an emanation from that Divine fire that burns the Seraphims: and the charity that raiſeth us above the condition of men, is a ſpark of that perſonal charity wherewith the Father and the Son love each other from all eternity.</p>
                  <p>But that we may not challenge the Holy Spirit as ſparing of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, he hath vouchſafed to be the accompliſhment of the Church, as he is the accompliſhment and perfection of the Trinity. For though there be no defects in God, though this Sun is never clouded nor eclipſed, this Supreme Truth labours under no ſhadows nor errours this excellent Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath no ſpots nor blemiſhes, and this amiable goodneſs be full of charms and graces; yet may the Holy Ghoſt be called the Complement thereof. The Father begins this adorable Circle, which the Son continues, and the Holy Spirit finiſheth: he it is that bounds the Divine emanations, draws forth the fruitfulneſs of thoſe that cauſe his production: and if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſpeak of an ineffable myſtery, and to ſubject to the laws of Time
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115672:39"/>Eternity it ſelf, God is not compleated, but by the production of the holy Spirit: He is the reſt of the Father and the Son; his perſon is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Trinity: and this Divine myſtery would want its full propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did it not include the Holy Spirit with the two Perſons from whence he proceeded. The holy Scriptures, to afford us ſome light of this verity, attribute all the perfection of the works of God to the bleſſed Spirit: They repreſent him to us moving upon the waters in the Creation of the world; finiſhing by his Fecundity, what the Father and the Son had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by their Power: They teach us that it was he that gave motion to the Heavens, influences to the Stars, heat to the Sun: They inform us that 'twas by his vertue that the earth became fruitful, and that from his goodneſs ſhe received that ſecret Fermentation that to this day renders her the Mother and the Nurſe of all things living. And the Goſpel, to give this Truth its full extent, inſtructs us, that 'tis the holy Ghoſt who by his graces in the Church makes up what Jeſus Chriſt hath begun in it by his travels. He is his Vicar and Lieutenant: he came down upon the earth, after the other aſcended up to heaven: nor hath he any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in his deſcenſion, then to compleat all the works of Jeſus Chriſt. The Apoſtles were yet but <hi>embryo</hi>'s in Chriſtianity when the Son of God left them: three yeers of converſation was not able to perfect them: the greateſt part of the diſcourſes of their Divine Maſter ſeemed to them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>Aenigma</hi>'s; his Maximes Paradoxes, his Promiſes pleaſing Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: every thing was a <hi>mormo</hi> to theſe timorous ſpirits: ths name of the Croſs ſcandalized them: and ſo many Miracles wrought in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, were unable to calm their Fear, or heighten their Courage. To finiſh theſe demi-works, the Holy Ghoſt came into the world: he deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon their heads in the ſhape of fiery tongues, to make them eloquent and bold: he inſpired them with Charity, to cure them of Fear; made them Lovers, thereby to make them Martyrs: he cleared their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, warmed their Will; that light and heat being blended together, they might more eaſily overcome Philoſophers and Tyrants. Finally, he ſet up a Throne in their hearts, that ſpeaking by their mouthes, and acting by their hands, he might render them accompliſht pieces to the ſervice of their Maſter. And indeed, we muſt acknowledge the Apoſtles changed their condition after the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt: their Fear vaniſhed, as ſoon as they were confirmed by his Strength; the Croſs ſeem'd ſtrew'd with Charms, as ſoon as they were kindled with his Flames: they found Sweetneſs even in Torments, Glory in Affronts,

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115672:40"/>coming down of the Holy Ghoſt, I will tell you: Before that happie moment, they had Faith, but they had neither Conſtancie nor Fidelity: they were able to forſake their poſſeſſions to follow Jeſus Chriſt, but they would not loſe their lives to glorifie him: they were able indeed to preach the Goſpel, but knew not how to ſigne it with their blood, nor ſeal it with their death: they were vertuous as long as they converſed with the Son of God up on earth; but they were not grown up to perfection, till the Holy Ghoſt had communicated to them his graces; and adding force to charity, had made them the Foundations of the Church, the Fathers of the Faithful, the Terrour of Devils, and the Aſtoniſhment of Tyrants. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, 'tis the holy Spirit, according to the ſaying of S. <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> that perfects the Chriſtians, becauſe 'tis he that Quickens them by Grace, and Deifies them with Glory: So that we are obliged to confeſs, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into alliance with them, that he is the ſame to the Church that he is to the Trinity, and that after he hath been our Bond, our Gift, and our Love upon Earth, he will be our Accompliſhment in Heaven.</p>

                  <head>The Fourth DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Holy Ghost ſeems to be to Christians, what he is to the Son of God.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is not without ground, that the Chriſtian is called the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, ſince he is his other Self; the one poſſeſſing by Grace, what the other doth by Nature. For if Jeſus be the Natural Son of the Father, the Chriſtian is his Adopted one; if Jeſus be the Heir of the Father, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is the Co-heir of the Son, according to the expreſſion of the great Apoſtle; if Jeſus be Innocent, the Chriſtian is Juſtified; if Jeſus be born of the Spirit, the Chriſtian is regenerated thereby; and receives in his Baptiſm, what the Son of God received in his Birth. Inaſmuch as this laſt wonderfully exalteth the glory of the Faithful, I conceive I ought to beſtow this whole Diſcourſe upon this matter, and to make it appear that the Holy Ghoſt, by an exceſs of bounty, will be to every Chriſtian what he is to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Faith teacheth us, that though Jeſus Chriſt be the Son of the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Father, yet is he withal the Workmanſhip of the Holy Spirit: he that was barren in Eternity, became fruitful in Time: he that produced nothing in the Heart of the Father, produced the Word Incarnate in the Womb of the Virgin: and he that before the world began was the Spirit of the Son, in the fulneſs of time became his Principle. The Scripture
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:115672:40"/>inſinuates this Truth, when it brings in the Angel ſpeaking theſe words to the Virgin, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee:</hi> And the Church teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it all her children, in the Symbole of her Creed, in theſe terms, <hi>He was conceived of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>

He was ſo born, ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> that he need not bluſh at the name of Son. This great priviledge is granted the Chriſtian in his Baptiſm; and his ſecond birth is as holy and as noble, as his firſt was ſhameful and criminal: In the one, he is a ſinner before he is reaſonable; and the ſlave of the devil, as ſoon as he is the ſubject of Jeſus Chriſt: but in the other, he is happily born again by the vertue of the Holy Spirit, he receives grace as an earneſt of glory, he is adopted by the Father for his ſon, acknowledged by Jeſus Chriſt for his brother, treated by the Angels as their equal, and exalted to ſo high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the holy Spirit diſdains not to be ſtiled the Author and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple thereof. This is it that holy Scripture holds out to us, by theſe words, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a man be born again of water and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf upon this meditation, had I not explained it already in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage of this Work: Neither would it be any hard matter to make it appear, that the Regeneration of a Chriſtian is little inferiour, in this particular, to the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond advantage that is common to them, is, that the ſame ſpirit which is their Principle, is alſo their Director; and that he that gives them life, gives them conduct and motion. Theſe two Things are inſeparable in Nature and in Grace; the ſame cauſes that make us live, make us act; theſe Starres whoſe influences contribute ſo much to our birth, are not leſſe conducing to our fortune; and as they are the Principles of our Being, they are in ſome ſort the Guides of our life; if they have no dominion over our ſpirit, they have over our humour; and if they force not our liberty, they many times ſollicite our inclinations. But not to reſt in ſecond Cauſes; it is plaine, the creature depends as well upon God in his motion as in his Being; he governs men whom he hath created, he guides Princes whom he hath raiſed to the Throne; and he as abſolutely hath their wills in his hands as their Scepter. By the ſame reaſon, the Holy Spirit which is the Principle of Jeſus Chriſt, is his Director; he undertakes nothing but by his conduct; and as he received his being from his goodneſſe, he ſubmits all his actions to his power: The Scriptures furniſh us with a thouſand proofes of ſo important a Truth; all the Evangeliſts are the faithfull Witneſſes thereof; neither doe they ever take notice of the deſigns of the Son of God,

                  <p>The Chriſtian enjoyes this advantage with Jeſus Chriſt; whatſoever deſigne he conceives, whatſoever reſolution he takes, whatſoever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize he brings to paſſe, he is alwayes bound to call upon the holy Ghoſt: He that hath given him his Being, ought to give him motion; he that hath begotten him in Baptiſme, ought to govern him in the Church, and if he will not be wanting to his obligations, nor renounce his priviledges, the ſame Spirit that inanimates him while he lives, muſt move and lead him in all his operations: This is it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo highly magnifies, when he ſayes, Thoſe onely deſerve to be called the children of God, who are acted by the Spirit of God. <hi>Qui Spiritu Dei aguntur hi ſunt filii Dei:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

Ser. 13. de verb. Apoſt.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> preventing two contrary objections which might be made againſt this truth, ſaith, That Chriſtians are not onely lead by the Spirit, but driven, to the end they may know that He is rather the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their actions, then themſelves, and that in the way of ſalvation, they are rather ſufferers then doers: But becauſe this anſwer might ſooth men up in idleneſſe, and give them an occaſion to neglect good works, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the enthuſiaſmes of the Spirit, he adds, They are moved, that they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:115672:41"/>might move; they receive the impreſſion of grace, that they may act; and that the Apoſtle expreſly made uſe of this manner of ſpeech, at once to make them ſhake off idleneſſe and preſumption.</p>
                  <p>From this Priviledge is derived a third, not ſo peculiar to Chriſt, as not to be common to Chriſtians; For the holy Spirit is their Maſter; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them both in his ſchool; and they have the glory to be his diſciples as well as his workmanſhip. The Son of God hath two ſchools, as he hath two births; the firſt is Eternity, where his Father is his Maſter, and where he teacheth him his learning, in communicating to him his Eſſence: There by a ſtrange Prodigie, the Maſter is not more knowing then the Scholar, nor the Scholar junior to his Maſter; the ſcience is learnt in a moment, but that moment endures for ever; and though it have no parts, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes nevertheleſſe all the differences of time; this ſcience, though but one, comprehends in it all ſorts of truth; the Maſter hides nothing from his Scholar, he inſtructs him at the ſame inſtant he begets him; the birth of this Son, to ſpeak properly, is his inſtruction: as he is born for ever, ſo he learns for ever: and he that conceived him in his boſome, is eternally his Father, and his Maſter: This Son hath in time another ſchool, and a new Maſter; he that produceth him, teacheth him; and the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that forms his body, faſhions his underſtanding from the very firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Conception.

This Pupill diſcourſeth before he ſpeaks, he conceives truth before he beholds the light, and his underſtanding is inform'd of all the ſecrets of his Father, before he could pronounce the name of his Mother: His knowledge grows not up with time, becauſe it had its juſt proportion and meaſure at the very moment of his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Experience hath not made it more evident, nor age more aſſured; and if he pronounced no Oracles in his Infancy, 'tis becauſe he had a minde to conceal his Wiſdom, as he had concealed his Divinity. Finally, this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Maſter taught him a ſcience, which Politicians ſeek for and cannot finde; for he diſcovers to him the ſecrets of the heart, the motions of the will, and all thoſe thoughts and imaginations, which though they never brake forth in words nor actions, ceaſe not to render men guilty: So that ſhould Jeſus Chriſt neither be united to the Perſon of the Word, nor illuminated with the light of Glory, he would nevertheleſſe have an infuſed knowledge, whereby he would be acquainted with whatever is moſt ſecret in Nature, and in Grace, in Time, and in Eternity. The holy Scripture alſo teacheth us that the holy Spirit that abides not alwayes in others, reſts upon Jeſus Chriſt;

                        <hi>Requievit ſuper eum Spiritus Domini.</hi> Iſa.</note> and he that diſtributes his Graces to others by meaſure, communicates them to his Maſterpeece without weight or limitation: But this is no hinderance from his being the Maſter alſo of all other Chriſtians, from teaching them the ſcience of ſalvation, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:115672:42"/>to them the myſteries of Theologie, the ſecrets of Nature, and the maximes of the Politikes: In effect, 'tis the holy Spirit that made the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles learned, that ſpake with their mouthes, that confounded Emperours and Philoſophers with their anſwers, and made them underſtand thoſe Oracles which were nothing but Riddles to them, whileſt Jeſus Chriſt converſed with them upon the earth; 'Tis laſtly, the ſelfe ſame Spirit, which to this day teacheth the faithfull what they are to beleeve in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what they are to do or leave undone in the practice of their life, and what they ought to hope or fear after death: He cannot deceive them, becauſe he is the Spirit of Truth; he cannot engage them in evill, becauſe he is the Spirit of Holineſſe; neither can he ſuffer them to wander in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or languiſh in infirmities, becauſe he is the Spirit of Counſell and of Strength; Therefore is he the Maſter whom the faithfull conſult with in their occaſions, 'tis in his Schoole that they commence in vertue, 'tis under his Conduct that they grow up to perfection, and by his advice that they defend themſelves againſt errour and falſhood.

                  <p>But to conclude all theſe reſemblances, we affirm that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the witneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the faithfull; and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for the Divinity of him, depoſeth daily for the Innocence of theſe.

This Spirit is the teſtimony of Jeſus and of the faithfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath formed them, and knows all their thoughts, whereof hee is the firſt Principle and Author: This alſo was he that deſcended upon the head of the Son of God in the forme of a Dove during the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Baptiſme; 'twas he that diſcovered to S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his Innocence, and taught him without ſpeaking that he was <hi>that Lamb of God that was to take away the ſins of the world.</hi> And hee it is that daily performs the ſame office to Chriſtians: For having been their Maſter, he vouchſafes to be their witneſſe; he ſpeaks to the eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their behalfe; having pleaded their cauſe, he gives them aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their ſalvation; The Reſt that calmes the waves of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is an effect of his teſtimony; thoſe ſighes and groans he draws from the bottome of their heart, thoſe deſires he inſpires them with for everlaſting good things, thoſe ſcorns he furniſheth them with for

                  </head>
                  <p>ONe of the chiefeſt advantages we ſhall partake of in Glory, is, that God will be to us in ſtead of all things; and that finding in him the accompliſhment of all our deſires, we ſhall there meet with our perfect felicity: He will be the Temple of the Bleſſed, becauſe they ſhall lodge in his Divine Eſſence: He will be for a garment to them, becauſe they ſhall be cloathed with his light: He will be their nouriſhment, becauſe he gives them eternal life; and, according to the language of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he will be <hi>All in all</hi> to theſe bleſſed inhabitants. The Holy Spirit ſeems to have a minde to make us taſte upon Earth the Happineſs of Heaven, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is all things to us in the Church; that he informs us in our doubts, comforts us in our afflictions, aſſiſts us in our conflicts, teacheth us in our prayers. For Chriſtians owe all that they are, and all that they do, to the holy Spirit: They live by his preſence, act by his power, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by his light, and love by his charity: All their advantages flow from him. If they are Saints, 'tis he that ſanctifies them: if they are free, 'tis he that ſets them at liberty: if they are generous, 'tis he that encourageth them: and if they be wiſe, 'tis he that enlightens them. In the mean time, the moſt part of the Faithful are ungrateful to the holy Spirit:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Liberalitem Dei ſervitutem faciunt.</hi> Tert.</note> They attribute that to their own power, which they derive from his; and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grace into a ſlavery, they would paſs for the Authors of a work whereof they are at moſt but the Miniſters. Therefore will I ſpend this Diſcourſe to let them ſee, that the holy Spirit inanimates them; and that as by his preſence he makes them live, ſo by his withdrawing himſelf he makes them die.</p>
                  <p>A Man and a Chriſtian have ſome reſemblance in their difference; they live both of them by the Spirit; and their life is rather ſpiritual then animal: For though Man have a body compoſed of the Elements, which hath need of the Air to breathe, of the Earth to bear it, of Food to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it, and of Light to make it ſee; yet is his ſoul the principle of his life; This Form inanimates the heart, giving it motion, whereby all the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:115672:43"/>other parts live. The abſence of the ſoul, is the death of the body; its preſence, the life: and when grief or weakneſs ſeparates them, Man ceaſeth to be a living creature. Inaſmuch as a Chriſtian is more excellent then a Man, by ſo much is his life more ſublime, and he hath a nobler principle of his Being: For the holy Spirit is his Soul; and paring off whatever defects that name may include, he is the Form that inanimates the Believer. Though he have an Underſtanding that reaſoneth, a Memory that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his conceptions, and a Will free and abſolute; yet does he live by the holy Spirit, and receive from him a ſupernatural life, which makes him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of God. As long as he is united to this Spirit, he is alive; aſſoon as he is parted from him, he is dead: And 'tis a miracle, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the ſoul, dead by ſin, does nevertheleſs enliven the body; and that notwithſtanding that imperfection,

It is true therefore, that the abſence of the holy Spirit greatly impaireth the vigour and clearneſs of Man: for the life of Man as a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature, and as a Chriſtian, are ſo intimately united together, that the one cannot be ſeparated from the other without an extreme detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and enfeebling of the creature. The Chriſtian merits not, till he begin to reaſon: Grace is idle in his ſoul, when Reaſon is not yet formed in it: and all Divines are of opinion, that children baptized have no other merits but thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt: Heaven is their Inheritance, but not their Recompence: they are in the condition of Heirs, but not of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: and the Crown they receive is rather the Conſequence of their good Fortune, then the Reward of their Labour. Man is yet more deplorable when he loſeth Grace, then when the Chriſtian loſeth Reaſon: for beſides that none of his actions are any longer meritorious, that he does nothing pleaſing to God; and having loſt the Principle of his ſupernatural life, he is deſtitute of all recompence and deſert: he hath moreover contracted this misfortune,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vita infidelium peccatum eſt; &amp; nihil eſt bonum, ſine ſummo bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no: ubi enim deeſt agnitio ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternae veritatis, falſa virtus eſt etiam in opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis moribus.</hi> Proſp. ſen. 106</note> that he is become the ſlave of Concupiſcence, which throws Darkneſs over his Underſtanding, Weakneſs into his Memory, and Malice into his Will: Under this conduct, he confounds Errour with Truth, Vice with Vertue; and having no other end but himſelf, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits as many ſins, as he intends to perform good works: Vain-glory is the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> that ſets him a going; he ſeeks for reputation in all his actions: and when he aſſiſts his Country, ſtands for the Laws, and fights for Liberty, he obeys a Tyrant which inſpires him with wicked intentions, even then when he ſeems to counſel him to the beſt and moſt upright un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. Thus Man becomes Wretched, when he ceaſeth to be Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: the loſs of Grace, cauſeth the enfeebling of his Liberty; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the holy Spirit involves him in a death ſo much the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by how much it is leſs ſenſible, and more concealed.</p>
                  <p>The Natural death makes a ſtrange havock in the body of Man: as ſoon as he ſeizeth upon the face, he baniſheth Beauty; horrour and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115672:43"/>fear always attend him; nor does he ever enter upon a body, but 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſtench and putrifaction. Theſe ſad effects render him ghaſtly; nor can the moſt confident behold him without ſome ſenſe of terrour and affrightment: But the ſpiritual death cauſeth indeed no amazement, becauſe it leaves no viſible characters of its malignity: The holy Spirit quits the ſinner with ſmall noiſe: his departure, which cauſeth ſo much misfortune, makes no buzzle at all: and when he withdraws his Grace from a ſoul, ſhe is no whit affected with it, becauſe the loſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. A Monarch thinks he is deprived of nothing, becauſe he ſtill exerciſeth abſolute command over his ſubjects; nor ſees that he is a ſlave to as many maſters as there are ſins that reign in his ſoul. A Philoſopher never conceits himſelf leſs happie, becauſe he is not more ignorant: the Light that remains in him, ſuffers him not to ſee his Blindneſs; and he imagines he is ſtill vertuous, becauſe he ſtill retains his knowledge. An immodeſt woman is never troubled at the loſs of Grace, becauſe it no ways impairs her good complexion: ſhe hath much ado to believe that ſin hath polluted her Soul, becauſe it hath ſtampt no deformity upon her Face: and beholding her ſelf in her glaſs as handſome after her fault as before, ſhe cannot perſwade her ſelf that ſhe is leſs amiable in Gods eyes, becauſe ſhe is not in her own. In the mean time, the loſs of Grace is the loſs of Life; the abſence of the holy Spirit, is the death of the Soul; and from the very inſtant he deſerts us, all Vertues bid us farewel: Whiles he keeps his reſidence in our hearts, thoſe glorious habits that render men vertuous, accompany them: and as the preſence of the Sun produceth Lilies and Roſes in our Gardens, the preſence of the holy Spirit produceth Hope and Charity in our Souls. 'Tis true, this Spirit is ſo good, that after he hath left us, he ſtill hovers about us: if he dwell not in our hearts, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears not to move and ſtir them; and if he Quicken us no longer by his, Grace, he incites us by his Power.</p>
                  <p>But to underſtand this Truth, which is one of the moſt important in Religion, we muſt know, there is this difference between the Soul and the Spirit: That moves no more, when once it ceaſeth to inanimate;

                  <p>The love men have to liberty, makes them wiſh that theſe motions of the Spirit were continuall, that at every moment he ſhould offer grace to the ſinner, that he could uſe it at pleaſure; and that in the ſtate of ſin, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the priviledges of the ſtate of innocene, his ſalvation might depend ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely upon his own will. Thoſe that make this objection, know not in my opinion, neither the greatneſſe of our crime, nor the power of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; God deales with the ſinner, much after another faſhion then he does with the Innocent;

But ſinfull man muſt be dealt with after another manner, the motion of the Spirit muſt be more vigorous, becauſe he undertakes an enemy; Grace muſt have more allurements, becauſe it meets with more impediments; muſt raiſe it ſelfe above the will, becauſe the will ſtoopes beneath ſelf-love; and God muſt be the Authour of mans ſalvation, becauſe man was the Authour of his fall.

The Holy Spirit is the Lord and Maſter of Grace, he diſpoſeth of it as pleaſeth him; and if ſometimes he deny it, there is none that can complaine. The children of <hi>Adam</hi> loſt it by the ſin of their Father, and the members of Jeſus Chriſt loſe it by their own: The former are excluded by their birth, the ſecond by their infidelity: The former are unfortunate, the latter criminall; and both of them living or dying in ſin, may juſtly expect nothing but condemnation.</p>

                  <p>But they reply, 'tis neceſſary that the holy Spirit acting in and by free creatures, depend in his motions upon their will, and concurre ſo gently with their free-will, that they be rather the Authors then the Inſtruments of their ſalvation: For we cannot conceive this dominion of the holy Spirit over mens hearts, but withall we muſt apprehend ſome violence which diminiſheth their merit, and weakens their liberty. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon, and Faith, furniſh us with anſwers to ſatisfie theſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

Faith perſwades the ſame truth upon much ſtronger arguments: for when it unites the holy Spirit with man, it gives all the advantage to the Creator, without ſuppoſing the leaſt injury done to the creature; it knows that God is more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with man, then man with himſelf, that he flows in upon the very eſſence of his will, that he can change all his inclinations; and being the Maſter of his workmanſhip, can diſpoſe of it as he pleaſeth, without the leaſt umbrage of conſtraint.</p>
                  <p>His Providence leads men to their end with as much force as ſweetneſs; his force hurts not their liberty, becauſe accompanied with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and his ſweetneſſe wrongs not his Majeſty, becauſe attended with force: whatever he does, he always acts like a Soveraign; his will findes no oppoſition that it ſurmounts not; and when he intends to execute his deſignes, he knowes as well how to prepare the heart of the guilty, as of the innocent. The firſt motions of Grace require no prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions in the ſoul; the ſecond beget a conſent without conſtraint, and both of them bear away man with ſo much force and ſweetneſſe, that he is never more free then when he is moſt powerfully drawn. Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo well tempers force, that it is never violent; and force ſo fully encourageth ſweetneſſe, that it meets with no impediment it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not. Thus God is abſolutely obeyed, man ſweetly born away; the one findes his glory in his power, the other his ſalvation in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and both of them after a divers manner finiſh one and the

This conduct is ſo diſtant from compulſion, that the ſtronger it is, the more gentle is it, the more ſubject man is to it, the freer his condition; the leſſe oppoſition hee hath, the more happy is hee and perfect. Jeſus Chriſt owes one part of his Sanctity to the obedience hee rendered to the Holy Spirit; the happy impotency hee was endued with not to reſiſt him, diminiſhed neither his merit nor his liberty; and hee blotted out our tranſgreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was as neceſſarily, as freely ſubject to his ordinances: The nearer Chriſtians approach to this ſtate, the more perfect are they; the more powerfull their grace is, the ſtronger is their liberty; the more effectuall the inſpirations of the Spirit are, the eaſier and more acceptable is there converſion.</p>

                  <p>NAture, whoſe providence cannot be ſufficiently admired, hath beene pleaſed that thoſe things that are moſt neceſſary ſhould be moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and that as it were preventing the deſires of men, they ſhould of their own accord offer themſelves to thoſe that enquire not after them. There is nothing more neceſſary then light; for beſides that it is the channel whereby the Sun ſheds his Influences upon the Earth, it ſerves for a guide to them that walk, diſcovers all the beauties of the world, and happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth thoſe of its Creator: So is there nothing more common in nature; it is communicated to all people, it ſuffers no partition; and covetouſneſſe and ambition which have divided Sea and Land, have found no way how to canton the light. As the Aire is more neceſſary then this, ſo is it alſo more common; it enters into priſons where day never dawns; it entertains thoſe wretches with life, who have loſt their liberty; it ſteales into the depths of the Sea, and the bowels of the Earth; neither is there any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is not refreſhed by its acceptable humidity. Grace imitates nature; it is prodigall of its Treaſures, the more Chriſtians ſtand in need of them, the more frequently are they diſpenced unto them; and out of the care it takes of their ſalvation, its good pleaſure is, that the moſt uſefull favours are alſo the eaſieſt to be obtained.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is an excellent proofe of this truth; for in the condition we are,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115672:45"/>there is no beleever that ſtands not in need thereof: the daily miſeries they ſuffer, obliges them to make uſe of it; and amongſt ſo many enemies that ſet upon them, they have no weapon but this wherewith to defend themſelves: 'Tis the portion of the Church Militant, and being ſtill in conflict, ſhe cannot implore ſuccour from heaven, but by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prayer:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Angeli &amp; bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti de Salute ſua ſunt ſecuri &amp; de noſtra ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi> Greg. Mag.</note> The Church Triumphant is wholly taken up with Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs, being freed from miſeries ſhe makes no vows but for us; and ſhe hath no other buſineſſe, but eternally to bleſſe him that is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of her bleſſedneſſe. But the Church Militant, who lives in a ſtrange Countrey, who hath as many enemies as neighbours, and who is well aſſured that the very name ſhe bears obliges her to combate, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunes Heaven by her prayers, ſends up ſighs to her Well-beloved, and cals upon him for help by the frequency of ſupplications. If Prayer be thus neceſſary, 'tis yet more common; for the Son of God tels us that bleſſings coſt us onely the pains to ask for them: <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive;</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will have us uſe this remedy in all our diſtreſſes, offering up this ſacrifice in all places, <hi>Volo vos orare omni loco:</hi> and Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the faithfull Interpreter of this great Apoſtle, aſſures us that to pray well, there is nothing required but to deſire well; that our interceſſion continues as long as our deſires doe; and that in keeping ſilence we ſpeak to God when we addreſſe our wiſhes to him; but though this remedy be ſo neceſſary and ſo common, yet is it neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of difficult performance; and to know well how to uſe it, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit muſt inſtruct us.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture whoſe words are Oracles, conferres this Elogie upon him particularly; it teacheth us that he it is that animates our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by his calentures, that inſpires us with this confidence, which gives us boldneſſe to call God our Father; which draws tears from our eyes, ſighs from our hearts, and with groanes that cannot be expreſſed, whereof he is the Authour, blots out our ſins, and comforts our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In a word, if we beleeve the great Apoſtle, we know not the art to pray, if we have not learnt it in the School of the holy Spirit; the evils that oppreſſe us, may indeed inſpire us with eloquence, but not indite our prayer; and whatever need we feel, if Grace prevent us not, we cannot obtain a remedy. Self-love ſo blindes us, that if we be led by it, we ſhall rather beg our ruine then our ſalvation. Man is in ſo profound an ignorance, that he knows not what is profitable or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to him; he many times conceives deſignes, the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments whereof are ſad and diſmall to him; and <hi>Seneca</hi> had reaſon to ſay, that God was incenſed, when he granted our requeſts. If the ambitious give the reins to his paſſion that poſſeſſes him, he will never aske any thing but honours, and not conſulting whether Glory ſtain his humility, all his vows will have no other aim but the increaſe of his Fortune. If the Covetous take councell of his Intereſt, his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115672:46"/>prayers ſerve onely his covetouſneſſe, even to the injuring of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, whom he will never ſtrive to gain, but that he may be the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his unjuſt deſires: If the Laſcivious purſue the motion of wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe that tyranniſeth over him, perhaps he will grow inſolent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to demand of God the glutting of his brutiſh paſſion; ſo that according to the language of the Scripture, his prayer will be turned into ſin; and the more Petitions he puts up, the more offences will he commit. If a man who breathes nothing but revenge, implore the aid of Heaven in that wretched condition, his inclination ſtronger then his reaſon, will oblige him to intereſſe the Son of God in his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and out of an impudence worthy to be puniſhed, endeavour to engage him in his quarrell, who died upon the Croſſe for the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his enemies: Finally, the prayer of every ſinner will be a high ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge, and he will draw down upon his head the thunder of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even then when he thinks to appeaſe its anger. But when the Chriſtian ſuffers himſelfe to be guided by the Spirit, he intreats no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of God but what is well-pleaſing to him; all his conceptions are not leſſe beneficiall to himſelfe, then glorious for Jeſus Chriſt; and as the Principle that quickens him is Divine, all the Prayers that flow thence are Divine and Heavenly too. The glory of God is always dearer to him then his ſalvation; he never ſeparates the publick good from his own private intereſt, he prays for his Family when he petitions for the State; and knowing very well that he is a living member of the myſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt, he never makes any ſupplications that are prejudiciall to the Church.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Advantage we draw from the aſſiſtance of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Prayer, is, that he makes known to us the ſecrets to come, and carrying us beyond the preſent time, markes out all thoſe diſaſters the injuſtice of our deſires threaten us with. Our ignorance is one of the chiefeſt cauſes of our misfortunes; if we could read in thoſe eternall Annals, where mens adventures are imprinted, we ſhould perceive that the greateſt part of our deſires are more diſadvantageous to us, then the imprecations of our enemies; we are inquiſitive after the cauſes of our diſgrace in the night of futurity; we haſten our ruine by our impatience, and Heaven may eaſily plead excuſe for our miſchances, ſince they are very often the effects of our own prayers: God never takes greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on us, then when he grants us what we ſo earneſtly importune him for; nor is he ever more oppoſite to our ſalvation, then when he ſhews himſelf moſt favourable to our requeſts; our Fathers and Mothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our damnation, their wiſhes make us miſerable, and we need not wonder that calamities overwhelm us, ſeeing we live amongſt the Anathema's of our neareſt relations.</p>
                  <p>The holy Spirit happily remedies this diſorder; for knowing the full extent of Eternity, he ſees all the events that are to happen in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115672:46"/>of ſucceeding generations; ſo that he never inſpires us with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations that are not profitable to us; he diverts us from thoſe wiſhes which are prejudiciall to our ſalvation; he will not ſuffer us to ask a Curſe inſtead of a Bleſſing; and when he breathes in our heart, or ſpeaks by our mouth, our prayers always carry their reward with them; the very deniall of them is uſefull, and when he forbears to grant what we beſought him for, 'tis to exerciſe our patience, and crown our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</p>
                  <p>If he have ſo much reſpect to our intereſt, he hath no leſſe to the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt; and he ſo well ſorts his honour and our good together, that whatſoever is helpfull to us, is honourable to him. The greateſt part of ſinners intreat of God thoſe things that are oppoſite to his will, or unworthy of his greatneſſe; For whether paſſion tranſport them, or ignorance blind them, they require honours of him that was born in a Stable, and died upon a Croſſe; they expect pleaſures from him who ſpent his whole life in ſorrow, and whom the Scriptures by way of Excellency ſtyle a Man of Griefes; they hope for riches from him who lived in poverty, nor would receive any Diſciples into his School, that had not ſold their goods, and diſtributed them to the poor; they demand Earth of him that reigns in Heaven, the eſtabliſhment of their welfare in this world from him who is the Father of that which is to come; and taking no notice of their Creed, they begge time of him who promiſeth eternity. But the holy Spirit diſabuſeth Chriſtians, when he either enlightens or inſtructs them: For being the Spirit of the Son, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his intentions, he never puts them upon thoſe requeſts that are offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to him. When their hearts are encouraged with his Grace, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre Conſcience before Honour; Vertue before Intereſt; Grief before Pleaſure, and the will of God before their own inclinations; If ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they petition for periſhable goods, 'tis as farre as neceſſity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges them; and knowing that all ſuch demands are dangerous, 'tis with feare that they always commence ſuch ſuits, with reſervation that they continue them, and with ſubmiſſion that they conclude them. All their prayers are terminated with thoſe words of our bleſſed Saviour to his Father in the Garden: <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Finally, the ſame Spirit teacheth them innocent Stratagems, which they ought to make uſe of to pacifie the indignation of their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, and to obtain thoſe Graces they become Petitioners for. Men are ſo little acquainted with God,

In the mean time, the ſtate of Innocence was deprived of it: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe two priviledges were incompatible; neither would God grant this favour to men who had no excuſe for their ſin, becauſe it was abſolutely in their power not to commit it; we ſee not that they had this Prerogative, nor that <hi>Adam</hi> recovered from his Fall by the aſſiſtance of Original Juſtice. His Converſion is an effect of the Grace of JESUS CHRIST: If he bewailed his ſin, he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115672:48"/>is beholding to the merits of the Son of God:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nullus homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num tranſit ad Chriſtum ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat eſſe quod non erat, niſi cum poeniteat fuiſſe quod erat.</hi> Homil. 50.</note> and if he repented, 'twas not till he became Chriſtian. For the Divine Providence, which turns our Evils into Remedies, is pleaſed to make uſe of our weakneſs in the buſineſs of Repentance; and fortifying our Liberty by the vertue of Grace, ſettles us in a condition more humble indeed, but more ſure then that of Innocence: Therefore is it not founded ſo much upon the Will, as upon Grace, drawing its force much leſs from Man then from Jeſus Chriſt: He it is that hath inſtituted the remedy in his Church by a Sacrament, wherein the holy Spirit raiſeth up ſinners, after he hath regenerated them by Baptiſm. For as he is the Principle of our new life, ſo is he the Reſtorer thereof; as he gives it by his Grace, ſo he repairs it by his Goodneſs: he preſides in this ſacred Pool; and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtranger Miracles then the Angel did at the pool of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> he convinceth the Obſtinate, enlightens the Blinde, inſtructeth the Ignorant.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, this Sacrament hath always been lookt upon by Chriſtians as a chanel thorow which the holy Spirit pours forth his graces into the ſouls of ſinners. There it is that he works thoſe prodigies which aſtoniſh all Chriſtians; there it is that he acts as God, and by a victorious ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs triumphs over the liberty of Criminals; there it is that he changeth Perſecutors into Apoſtles, Wolves into Lambs, Libertines into Believers, and Laſcivious perſons into Continent. In the Old Teſtament, this Spirit changed men externally, indued them with new ſtrength, made uſe of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to tame Lions, take Cities, and defeat Armies: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord came upon Samſon, aad he ſlew a thouſand men.</hi> He changed the minde of thoſe that he lifted up to the Throne; and putting the Scepter into their hands, inſpired the Politicks into their ſoul, and taught them that Science whereby Soveraigns govern States and Kingdoms: <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall come upon thee, and thou ſhalt be changed into another man.</hi> But now he changeth the hearts; he cauſeth a Metamorphoſis leſs glittering, but more uſeful, inſpiring into the ſoul Repentance, and Sorrow for Sin.</p>
                  <p>This Change is attributed to the holy Spirit, becauſe being the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Love,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſt Spiritus ſanctus in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente; jam ad donum Spiritûs ſancti pertinet, quia tibi diſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet quod feciſti; immundo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui peccata pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, ſancto diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicent.</hi> Aug.</note> all the effects which deſigne any goodneſs, are particularly applied to him: and our Religion knows none greater then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God receives his enemy into favour; where, not conſidering his Greatneſs, he prevents him by his Mercy; nor minding the many ſins he hath committed, treats with him not as a Rebellious Slave, but as an obedient Son. This belongs to the holy Spirit, becauſe, being that ſacred Bond that unites the Father with the Son from all Eternity, it concerns him to reconcile ſinners to God, who are ſeparated from him by their offences, according to the language of the Prophet; <hi>Your ſins have ſeparated between you and your God.</hi> Finally, this effect is ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115672:48"/>to him, that he is pleaſed to take it for his Name: For the Church in her Oraiſons calls it the Remiſſion of Sins: And as to flatter the ambition of Conquerours, they beſtow upon them the names of thoſe Provinces they have reduced under their obedience, the Church is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that worthily to praiſe the holy Spirit, to his Divine Qualities, this glorious Title muſt be added; and to ſpecifie the victories he gains over ſinners, to name him, by way of excellence, <hi>The Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> This Maxime is ſo true, and the pardon of our offences ſo particularly attributed to the holy Ghoſt, that the Miniſters who are employed in this Sacrament, muſt be quickned with his vertue to blot out ſins. For, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> judiciouſly obſerves, the Apoſtles received not the power to abſolve the Guilty, till they had received the holy Ghoſt; nor did the Son of God ſay unto them, Remit ſins, till he had before ſaid unto them, Receive the holy Ghoſt; that they might know it was through his Name that they wrought this Miracle, and that they were onely his Organs, when they diſpenſed Grace in the State of their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
                  <p>This will not ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that ſhall conſider, there is no greater power in the Church then to forgive ſins: For 'tis in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to act upon a Non-entity; 'tis to imitate the power of God, and to extract Grace out of Sin, as the World out of Nothing. Beſides, if we believe Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> the Converſion of ſinners hath ſomething more difficult in it then the Creation of men. For though in both theſe works God act upon nothing, <hi>David</hi> telling us, that to change a heart, is to create it: <hi>Create in me, O God, a clean heart;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſſuring us, that our ſoul is created in good works, when we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: <hi>Creati in bonis operibus;</hi> It ſeems God meets with more reſiſtance in Converſion, then in Creation. Nothing obeys God, when it hears his Word; if it contribute not to his deſignes, neither doth it oppoſe them; and no ſooner hath God made known his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but it thruſts forth out of its barren womb, The Heaven with its Stars, the Earth with its Fields, and the Sea with its Rocks: <hi>He ſpake, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.</hi> But Sin is a Non-entity, rebellious againſt God; it knows his minde, and contemns it; ſets up parties in his State, deboiſts his ſubjects; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching it ſelf in their heart, as in a Fort, diſputes the victory with their Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there is no body but knows that God acts far more abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in the Creation of Men, then in the Converſion of Sinners. For when he drew man out of Nothing, he adviſed with none but Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; he had no reſpect to his Liberty, becauſe he handled him as a Slave; and ſpeaking imperiouſly to him, obliged him to appear before his Creator. But when he Converts him, he uſes ſome kinde of reſpect towards him; he puts on rather the deportment of a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115672:49"/>Lover, then of a Soveraign; he gains his will without forcing it; and though he knows the ſecret whereby to be obeyed, 'tis always with ſo much ſweetneſs, that he that ſuffers himſelf to be overcome, hath reaſon to believe he gets the Victory. Therefore doth the Scripture never ſpeak of this Change, but as of a work common to God with Man: And when Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves the differences between Converſion and Creation, he bears witneſs to this truth, in theſe words, <hi>Qui creavit te ſine te, non ſalvabit te ſine te.</hi> But not to enter into Diſputes more Curious then Profitable,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si converſio pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoris non eſt majoris potentiae quàm creatio univerſi, ſaltem eſt majoris mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcricordiae.</hi> Aug.</note> let us be content to conclude with the ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that if the Converſion of a ſinner require not more Power, it ſuppoſeth at leaſt more Mercy then Creation; becauſe if in This God obligeth the Miſerable, in That he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth the Criminal, ſhewing Favour to thoſe that could expect nothing but ſeverity of Puniſhments. Therefore is it that the Converſion of a ſinner belongs to the Holy Spirit: and a work that bears the Character of Goodneſs, muſt needs have no other Principle but he to whom this Divine Perfection is attributed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that after he hath ſhewed mercy to ſinners, he performs a piece of moſt exemplary Juſtice; and animating them againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he obliges them to take revenge and puniſhment upon themſelves: For, one of the moſt admirable effects of the Spirit of Love, is, to produce hatred in the ſpirit of Penitents,
<note place="margin">

They look upon themſelves as guilty of Treaſon againſt the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: they ſtay not till his Juſtice puniſh them; they prevent his Sentence, by their own Reſolutions; and invent more tortures to wrack themſelves, then the Executioners have been witty in to torment Martyrs with. This is that Divine Spirit which hath driven the <hi>Anchorites</hi> into the deſarts, made the <hi>Antonines</hi> go down into caves and holes of the earth, made the <hi>Stilites</hi> fix upon the top of Pillars; which found out ſackcloth and diſcipline to make as many Wretches as he had made Penitents. All the Auſterity that is in Chriſtianity, takes its birth from the love he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires into the Faithful: Their Rigour is proportionable to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: the more the holy Spirit poſſeſſeth them, the more are they ſet againſt Themſelves: and we may affirm with reaſon, that as much as they grow in his Love, ſo much do they grow in the Hatred of their Sin.</p>
                  <p>This is it, perhaps, that our Saviour would have us underſtand, when he told us that the holy Spirit ſhould judge the world, and ſhould oblige ſinners to puniſh themſelves for the offences they have committed: <hi>He ſhall convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgement.</hi> We cannot underſtand this Truth, if we conceive not that the Father hath judged all men in his Son; and having charged him with their iniquities, hath charged
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:115672:49"/>him alſo with the puniſhments due for them. From this moment they have no engagements to ſue out with the Father; and the Father, ſatisfied with the Paſſion of his Son, proteſts that he hath ſigned over to him all the right of judging the world: <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.</hi> The Son, by vertue of this reſignation, ſhall judge all men at the end of the world, and being become their Judg and their Partie, will pronounce the definitive ſentence of their Eternity. In expectation of this day of Doom, the holy Spirit judgeth men that are converted; and mixing meekneſs with ſeverity in theſe determinations, he obliges them to undergo a ſcrutiny upon earth, to be delivered from the torments of hell. Nor are we to think it ſtrange, that he that is ſo gentle, is withall ſo rigorous, ſince the Poets have beſtowed theſe two qualities upon <hi>Love;</hi> For theſe pleaſant Tel-tales have feigned, that he was the ſevereſt of all the Gods, that he bathed himſelf in tears, lived upon blood, and (more cruel then Tyrants) took pleaſure in the torments of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But Chriſtian Religion, that conceals Truth under the ſhadow of our Myſteries, teacheth us, that the love of God is ſevere, that he exacts chaſtiſements from thoſe he inanimates, that he engageth his Lovers in penance, and (more ſtrong then death, which parts ſoul and body) he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides between the ſoul and the ſpirit, and exerciſeth a Tyranny over whole entire man.</p>
                  <p>True it is, the torments he inflicts are always mix'd with pleaſures; he makes Roſes grow among Thorns, and amidſt ſuch a throng of Penitents that bid him battel, there is not one complains of his ſufferings: 'Tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that perſecuting themſelves,

They are better accompanied in the Deſarts, then the Monarchs in their Palaces; their humiliations are more glorious then the Triumphs of Conquerors, their poverty is more happy then abundance of riches, and their aſcetick life more full of charms then the pleaſures of the world.</p>
                  <p>Though the holy Spirit be thus favourable to Penitents, yet fails he not to be very ſevere againſt ſinners: if he pardon the offences committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Father and the Son, he never pardons thoſe that are committed againſt his own Perſon; and the holy Scriptures teach us,
<note place="margin">

This paſſage leaves all our Expoſitors at a loſſe; every one forgeth new Principles to reſolve the difficulties thereof, and there are few but ſtrive to invent ſomething upon a ſubject ſo often handled, and ſo little cleared. Some divide ſins into three Orders, according to the perfections which are commonly applyed to the three Divine Perſons: The firſt comprehends ſins of infirmity, which ſeem to claſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115672:50"/>the Perſon of the Father,
<note place="margin">

D.</hi> Thom. in Paulum.</note> to whom power belongs: The ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes ſins of ignorance, which ſeem to injure the Perſon of the Son, to whom Wiſdom is attributed; The third comprehends ſins of malice, which ſeem to maligne the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, to whom Goodneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs. Following this diviſion, they ſuppoſe that the firſt and ſecond ſort of ſins deſerve ſome pardon, becauſe the weakneſs and ignorance wherwith they are accompanied may plead ſomewhat in their excuſe; but the laſt are altogether unworthy of pardon, becauſe malice is the very ſoul of them, and that thoſe that have committed them had ſtrength and light enough not to fall into them. But if this Maxime were true, there were not any Chriſtian that would hope for the pardon of his ſins, ſince being enlightned by Faith, and aſſiſted by Grace, they need neither eys to ſee them, nor hands to withſtand them: Nay, all the world knows, there is not any ſinner in whoſe ſoul Malice, Weakneſs, and Ignorance are not blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded together: Concupiſcence, which blinds their Underſtanding, enfeebles their Will; and ſin reigning in both of them, inſpires them with Malice. Thus every ſinner would grow deſperate, and having offended the holy Spirit, could not expect the remiſſion of his ſins.</p>
                  <p>Others explain this paſſage of Hereticks, who knowing the Truth, do notwithſtanding contradict it; who perſecute the Church becauſe ſhe is the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſerving for Miniſters to the Divel, do their utmoſt to ruine the workmanſhip of the Son of God: But we have ſeen Hereticks converted, who have ſtood for the defence of the Truth, having quitted that of a Lye; and who have gained ſubjects to Jeſus Chriſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had procured ſlaves for his Enemy. Some others underſtand it with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> of that ſin that accompanies men till death, and which always reſiſting Grace, cannot be expiated but by the pains of hell: <hi>Pro quibus jam non eſt hoſtia, ſed terribilis quaedam expectatio judicii.</hi> This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication doubtleſs is the moſt aſſured, for that the ſin wherein any one dies is certainly irremiſſible; but I do not know whether this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be the trueſt: For it ſeems, the Son of God would plainly and ſimply inſinuate unto us the difference between ſinners that oppoſe the deſignes of the Father and the Son, and thoſe who reſiſt the deſignes of the Holy Ghoſt;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ad hoc Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor eſt Chriſtus, ut eos qui receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerant à Patre per ſe reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, &amp; ſuo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine eorum peccata ſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret.</hi> Aug. in Pſal. 93. ſer. 2.</note> for though the firſt be culpable, and have done very ill to neglect the Father, ſpeaking to them by the mouth of the Prophets, yet might they hope for ſome impunity in their crimes, and promiſe themſelves, that the Son coming upon the earth, would reconcile them to his Father: Though the ſecond were more to blame then the firſt, and deſerve a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer puniſhment for not hearing the Son, who taught them by his examples, inſtructed them by his diſcourſe, and raviſhed them with his miracles: They might yet perſwade themſelves, that the Holy Ghoſt deſcending down amongſt them, would convert them, and that ſubmitting to his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yeelding obedience to his Councels, would change their bad life into a better: But the laſt, who reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, can have no more
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115672:50"/>hope, their ſin, conſidering the diſpoſition of the Orders of God, is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible of its own nature; for they no longer expect a divine Perſon that may reconcile them with the others: The miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt is the laſt, and the Scripture holds forth nothing more to be expected, but the coming of Jeſus Chriſt to judge both the quick and the dead. Thus their ſin who reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">

Thus to conclude in a few words all that we have delivered in this diſcourſe; The Holy Ghoſt remits the ſins of the world, reconciles ſinners to God, animates them againſt themſelves to give him ſatisfaction; but acting after another manner with obſtinate perverſe tranſgreſſours, he gives them up to their impiety, and juſtly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them that grace which they have inſolently deſpiſed.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115672:51"/>particular, and takes it's originall from all thoſe devaſtations ſin hath made in nature.

The experience he hath of his infirmity, obligeth him to implore the ſuccours of Heaven, knowing very well, that victory is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compleat upon earth; he intreats an end of his life, to obtain that of his conflict; and being not ignorant that his vigour is abated by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, which he can neither defeat nor divorce, he implores an Aid that ſupplyes his impotency, and renders him ſtrong enough not to be worſted.

                  <p>But this misfortune is yet much greater in ſinners newly converted, then in the juſt, who have a long time perſevered in this vertue: For if theſe laſt have not deſtroyed ſin, they have debilitated him; and if they have not obtained a full victory, they have gain'd ſome advantage over this Enemy; if they have not quite obſtructed his motions, they have greatly check'd them; and if they have not ſtrength to be delivered, they have courage enough to ſtand upon their guard and defend themſelves: But the others have encreaſed his power by their own cowardiſe, they have added the tyranny of Habit to that of Concupiſcence; they are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a wretched impotency to withſtand, ſince they have not cruſh'd him in his conception; and their liberty is ſo ſmall to defeat him, that their ſlavery degenerates for the moſt part into down-right neceſſity. Thence it came to paſſe, that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> being fallen into that deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable condition, complain'd that his bad Habit had fettered his Will, that he groan'd under the weight of his irons, that he could not break them though he had hammered them himſelf, and having voluntarily thrown himſelf into the net, he was neceſſarily held faſt in it. <q>My Will (ſaith he admirably in his Confeſſions) was in the hands of mine Enemy, he had caſt a chain about me, which manacled me ſo faſt I could not diſengage my ſelf, but was forced to follow him: for of my bad inclinations he formed bad deſires, which baſely obeying, I contracted a bad habit; and not timely reſiſted, was preſently changed into a troubleſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. I call this ſlavery a Chain, becauſe it was compoſed of my own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations as of ſo many links, which the Grace that prepar'd me for my Converſion was not ſtrong enough to break aſunder.</q> He made vain attempts to be diſengaged; his Will encourag'd with Grace, ſtoutly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Will ſeconded with Concupiſcence; himſelf was the Theater of this Combat, he was the Victor and the vanquiſhed; but the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was more prejudiciall then the defeat, ſince the worſe party was the ſtrongeſt, and his Will yeelding obedience to the Tyranny of Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, reſiſted the Command of Charity: He pleaſantly complains to God of the greatneſs of this Evill in the ſame place of his Confeſſions. <q>In vain did I take pleaſure in Your Law concerning the inward man, becauſe there was another law in the rebelling againſt Yours, and which againſt my will made me ſubject to the law of ſin that was in my members:</q> For the law of ſin is nothing elſe but the Tyranny of Cuſtome, which engageth the minde of man with a kinde of conſtraint, but not without ſome colour of Juſtice, becauſe he willingly procured this Thraldom.</p>
                  <p>But he never more happily expreſs'd the nature of this Evill, then when he compares a bad Habit to the imperious complacency of ſleep: For it ſeems, there is nothing more ſweet then thoſe drowſie vapours; in the mean time there is nothing more violent; and of all things that ſet upon a man, there is none from which he can leſſe defend
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:115672:52"/>himſelfe; This evill takes force from it's ſweetneſſe, the more pleaſant the fumes are it exhaleth, the ſtronger are they; the more pain they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the more is their pleaſure, the leſſe liberty they indulge us, the more is the love they expreſſe toward us. 'Tis by this example, that this great Saint illuſtrates the agreeable violence of a bad habit.

True it is, as there is no man that would always ſleep, and in the judgement of all wiſe men, watchings are better then ſleep, I alſo was of the ſame opinion, that 'twas more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous for me to ſubmit to thy grace (O Lord) then to yield to my paſſion: But as the moſt part of men ſuffered themſelves to be more ſweetly charm'd with ſleep when their hour to awake approacheth, ſo did I more enticingly imbrace my bad habit, when the time of my converſion ſeemed neareſt at hand". It is but too evident by this compariſon, that mans weakneſſe paſſeth even to impotency, when he ſuffers himſelfe to be ſwallowed up by ſin, and in his infirmities ſtands in need of a mighty arme to deliver him from the Tyrant that keeps him under.</p>
                  <p>Now the holy Spirit performs this good office to all ſinners, 'tis he that breaketh their irons when they are fetter'd by concupiſcence, or by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmity,</hi> ſaith great Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he not only clarifies the Chriſtians, but fortifies them; and the ſame grace he ſheds abroad in their ſouls, at once fils them with light and ſtrength; he joynes himſelfe with the ſoule to ſubdue the rebellions of the fleſh; he inſpires their liberty with a new vigour, knocking off it's fetters, he armes the faculty, whereby it takes vengeance of it's enemies: for as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> excellently obſerves, 'tis not the Spirit of man, but of God that fights againſt the fleſh;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Spiritus concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcit adverſus carnem in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minibus bonis, non in malis, qui Spiritum Dei non habent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra quem caro concupiſcat.</hi> Aug.</note> theſe two parts almoſt continually agree in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers and wicked men, if they practiſe hoſtility for their particular intereſts concupiſcence unites them to ſerve her deſignes.

But when the ſoule fights againſt the fleſh; in the faithfull, 'tis always by the motion of the ſpirit, 'tis this divine Protection that gives her courage, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her from the bondage of her ſlave eſtabliſheth her in the poſſeſſion of her lawfull authority.</p>
                  <p>Let us explain this Truth in the words of Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> the fleſh did not luſt againſt the ſpirit in Paradiſe, there was no warre in ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a peace, nor did man ſee himſelfe divided by the conflict of two parts, whereof he was made: But when once he had violated the Law of God, and had refuſed obedience to his Soveraign. he was given over to himſelfe, upon condition too that he ſhould never be his own Maſter, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115672:53"/>be wholy at his devotion that had deceived him. Then was it that the fleſh began to revolt againſt the ſpirit; but this happens not but in the perſon of good men; for in that of wicked men the fleſh hath nothing to rebell againſt, becauſe the ſoule being become carnall, hath no other feelings but thoſe of the fleſh. And when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the ſpirit warreth againſt the fleſh,</hi> we are not to imagine that he ſpeaks of the ſpirit of man, but of that of God, that fights in us againſt our ſelves; or to ſpeak more ſoundly, 'tis he that combates that in us that is prejudiciall to us; and when he makes warre upon us, 'tis to procure peace within us. 'Tis in this ſenſe that the ſame Apoſtle hath ſaid further to the faithfull, that if by the vertue of the ſpirit they did mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, they ſhould live. For leaſt man ſhould grow proud in hearing thoſe words, and perſwade himſelfe that it was by his own ſpirit that he ought to tame the fleſh, the Apoſtle preſently explains himſelfe, that they are the Children of God that are led by the Spirit, to the end we may know that 'tis he that mortifies our fleſh, quickens our ſoule, and gives us victory in the Conſlict.</p>
                  <p>'Tis for this cauſe that he is called in Scripture <hi>the Spirit of ſtrength, and of counſell,</hi> to teach us, that the ſame that guides doth alſo aſſiſt us; that having enlightned us, he warmes us too, inſpiring us with courage to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute our deſignes, after he hath endued us with wiſdome to deviſe and contrive them. But Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> informs us, that he acts otherwiſe with ſinners, then with the godly; and that he carries himſelfe after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhion with thoſe he moves only,

But finally, 'tis one and the ſame Spirit that aids all Chriſtians in their different converſations: 'Tis he that triumphs over the Executioners in the Martyrs, that combates Hereticks in the Doctours, that ſubdues the fleſh in the Continent, that deſpiſeth the pleaſures of the world in the Anchorites, that conquers ſinne in the Penitents, and that leads all the Elect from the Camp of the Church Militant into the boſome of the Church Triumphant.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Hydra</hi> of the Poets never was ſo fruitfully pregnant, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with all it's inventions, could never yet repreſent the ſtory of our misfortunes.

                  <p>Indeed Chriſtians meet with a great deale of conſolation in theſe diſtreſſes; for beſides that the hope of futurity ſweetens their preſent evils; that the example of Jeſus Chriſt gives them encouragement; that the conſtancy of Martyrs bear up their ſpirits, they have received the Holy Spirit that comforts them in their troubles, and ſupplies them with as many remedies, as misfortune takes upon it ſhapes to aſſault them. Let us reduce both of them to four heads, and make it appear in their diſcourſes, that 'tis not in vaine that man beares the name of miſerable, and the Holy Spirit that of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.</p>
                  <p>One of the fearfulleſt torments of man a ſinner, is, that the two parts whereof he is made, cannot agree:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In te ex teipſo eſt flagellum tuum, fit rixa tua tecum, lucta eſt in illo corpore; quamdiu vivimus pugnamus, quamdiu pugnamus periclitamur.</hi> Aug.</note> The body and the ſoule are always upon bad terms; their love is turned into hate, and if there be any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, 'tis always to the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the nobler part: All is out of order in the maſter-piece of the Creation; Earth is higher then Heaven; the Beaſt domineers over the Angell; the Spirit ſtoops to the Body, and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:115672:54"/>are the Miſtreſſes of Reaſon. The Saints groan under this diſorder; they invoke death to be freed from this Tyranny, and they intreat an end of their life that they may ſee an end of a Combate whoſe event is ſo doubtfull. The Holy Spirit accommodates this difference by his grace; for he takes part with the ſoule againſt the body; he ſubjects the ſoule to God, thereby to ſubject the body to the ſoule; he ſets things in the ſtate they were in during the time of Innocence, and ſo ſuppreſſeth the revolts of the fleſh, that if the Spirit be not abſolute, it is at leaſt the ſtrongeſt in the Saints. 'Tis the grace of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforter, ſay the Fathers of the Church, that ſweetens our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, that quencheth the impure flames that concupiſcence kindles in our hearts, that ſubdues thoſe violent paſsions whoſe firſt motions are of ſo difficult coercion; 'Tis it that charmes thoſe deceitfull hopes and deſires that promiſe us felicity in the World, and which finally following the Inclinations of this Spirit, whereof it is the Image in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables the Chriſtian to be revenged of thoſe rebells that diſturb the quiet of his perſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond puniſhment of guilty man, is to ſee himſelfe exiled from heaven, and conſtrain'd to endure a baniſhment as long as life: Indeed he undergoes here all the miſeries of an exterminated perſon; he is deprived of his goods, and lives not but upon borrowing or almes; he is driven out of Paradiſe, fallen from all thoſe honours that equal'd his condition, to that of Angels and reduced to a deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate,
<note place="margin">

He never looks up to heaven, but if there be any ſpark of piety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, he bewailes his offence, and is afflicted at his baniſhment: Griefe puts theſe complaints in his mouth: <hi>Wo is me becauſe my habitation is prolonged.</hi> He is afraid leaſt the ſnares that are ſcattered in the place of his reſidence, entangle him; if he ſuffer any calamity, he preſently reflects upon the happineſſe he hath loſt; and if he taſte any pleaſures, he misſtruſts, leſt they engage him in the world. For Chriſtians are threatned with this double evill; and if they take not good heed, they are in danger to love their exile, and forget their Countrey; they ſettle their fortune upon earth, they build as if they never meant to remove; they are ſtrongly taken up with the preſent world, and they loſe all beliefe of the future; and a man hath much adoe to perſwade them, that ſo delightfull an Abode is the place of their Baniſhment, and the Theater of their Torment; They muſt be made feele their miſeries, that they may have ſome deſire towards another life; and we think we have gained much upon their Spirit, when they will be perſwaded to look with an indifferent eye upon the place of their birth.

Now the Holy Spirit comforts them in this reaſonable diſguſt; he inſpires them with the deſire of heaven, points out the glory of the bleſſed; fills them with hope of the ſhortening of their exile; and makes them ſay with <hi>David, I was glad when they ſaid unto me we will go into the houſe of the Lord.</hi> But the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall Comfort he makes uſe of to mitigate, and ſweeten their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, is, to give them an Antepaſt of felicity, to render them happy in the midſt of their miſeries; and to ſhed his graces into their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with ſo much complacency, that converſing with men, they may reliſh the bliſſe of Angels.

                  <p>The third grievance of Man a Sinner is, That the Earth is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a place of Baniſhment, but a Countrey of Enemies, where all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſerving as Inſtruments of the Divine Juſtice, make warre upon him, which ends not till he dyes. For though he boaſt himſelfe the Lord of the Univerſe, though the ſinne of his father perſwade him into this errour, though Concupiſcence that reigns in his ſoule, heightens the deſire thereof, nor can all the miſeries he endures, ſhake him out of this hope; yet is he dealt with as a Criminall.

The holy Sacrament is the higheſt invention the charity of the Son of God could finde out; none but an infinite Wiſdome could deſigne it, nor could any but an abſolute uncontrolled Power put it in execution; both of them are drained in this Myſtery; and when the Son of God is incarnated upon our Altars to enter into our hearts, there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favour to be wiſhed for upon earth: Nevertheleſſe, experience

For ſome are of opinion, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of this word to <hi>quench,</hi> becauſe the Holy Ghoſt coming down upon the Apoſtles in the likeneſſe of Fire, might be put out as fire by our negligence: And if the veſtall Virgins were guilty of death,

Others think it a kind of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſpeech, the Apoſtle makes uſe of to aggravate the hainouſneſs of the ſinne they commit, who do all that they can to extinguiſh the Holy Spirit, and endeavour to imitate the cruelty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> will ſigne their malice by a deteſtable parricide: It ſeems Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was entred into this opinion, accuſing not the ſinner for the death of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but becauſe of the will he had to do it; and endeavouring all that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:115672:57"/>was in his power to ſtifle him, that lives and reigns with the Father and the Son from all Eternity. But I conceive, without doing violence to the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> or at all prejudicing the holy Spirit, we may ſay, He ſuffers death by ſin, and loſeth life when we loſe charity. For the ſame Apoſtle teacheth us,

All his Epiſtles ſpeak this language; and as often as he treats of the reſidence of the holy Spirit in our hearts, he ſpeaks of it as of a Divine life, whereof he is the firſt Principle; ſo that he lives in us after the ſame manner as we live in him; and theſe two lives are ſo cloſely combined together, that one cannot be deſtroy'd without the other: Thus the holy Spirit ceaſeth to live in the ſinner, when the ſinner ceaſeth to live by the holy Spirit; As they have one and the ſame life, ſo they endure one and the ſame death; and as the ſinner loſeth life, becauſe he loſeth Grace that united him to Jeſus Chriſt; ſo the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit in ſome ſort loſeth that life that united him to the Chriſtian by Charity, and receives death from him that inflicts it upon himſelf by ſin. Therefore is it that the Apoſtle uſeth ſuch high terms to make us comprehend the heinouſneſſe of our crime, and deſcribes the death of our ſoul, under that of the holy Spirit, to the end, that if we are not afraid to commit a ſimple Murder, we may at leaſt be ſtartled from committing a Parricide.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Quality of the holy Spirit, is, that having been our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, he will alſo be our Director, and give us motion after he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued us with life. I will not inlarge this Truth, becauſe I have already ſpoken ſufficiently of it, and diſcovered thoſe advantages the Chriſtian may draw from thence. It ſhall ſuffice to add, that Chriſtians are exalted as far above Philoſophers, as Philoſophers are above Beaſts: For Beaſts are led meerly by ſenſe, the pleaſure that tickles them tranſports them, and what-ever flatters their appetite, either in taſte or ſight, overpowers them, if they are not with-held by fear or grief: Sinners are in no better condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then the Brutes, they conſult only their ſenſe when they act,

But though he act with ſo much ſtayedneſs, he makes his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der roar over the heads of the guilty, he makes the earth open under their feet; and if theſe two Elements are not enough to deſtroy them,

                  <p>Finally, to conclude this Diſcourſe; One of the moſt eminent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the holy Spirit is that of the Remiſſion of ſins; his Spouſe making his Panegyrick, honours him with this Elogie: and Divinity teacheth us, that he it is that prepares the Will of the ungodly, that manageth their Conſent by the endearments of his Grace, and reconciles them to the Father by the merits of the Son, which he applyes to them: Thence is it that he preſides in the work of Repentance; that the Prieſts who abſolve the guilty, are his Miniſters; and the ſorrow that blots out ſin is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his Mercy.

Thence it comes to paſſe that theſe auſtere vertues, that have nothing elſe to do, but to combate the motions of the fleſh, had ſerv'd rather for his ornament, then for his defence. Thence it followes that Grace had not been the Miſtreſſe of the Will, becauſe having no bad inclinations, ſhe might have guided her ſelfe, provided ſhe were but ſupported; nor had there been any danger that ſhe that was not yet a Captive to ſinne, ſhould have the chiefe diſpoſall of his ſalvation: we are not certain that if <hi>Adam</hi> had preſerved his innocence, his children had been impeccable; neither know we if the ſinne of other men had injur'd their poſterity; and if having loſt the advantages of originall righteouſneſſe in their own behalfe, they had loſt them alſo as concerning their ſucceſſours: This condition is ſo conceal'd that we have nothing but weak conjectures of it; every one extolls or debaſeth it according to his humour; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither Scripture nor Tradition for their rule, all the world may diminiſh or adde ſomething to their happineſſe.</p>

                  <p>For his ſinne is the ſource and fountain of all misfortunes: we are not guilty but becauſe we are his Members, we ſinn'd by his will, becauſe we lived in his perſon; and the offence of one man is become the obliquity of whole Nature, becauſe it was included in him as the Tree in the Kernell, or as a River in the Head.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quia vero per liberum arbitrium Deum deſeruit, juſtum Dei judicium expertus eſt, ut cum tota ſua ſtirpe quae in illo adhuc poſita tota cum illo peccaverat damnaretur.</hi> Aug.</note> This is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teacheth us, in thoſe no leſſe handſom then ſolid expreſſions. <hi>Adam</hi> felt the juſt judgement of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe abuſing his free will, he was unjuſtly ſeparated from him, and puniſhment was inflicted upon him with his whole race, becauſe being in him as in the ſtock, they had wholly tranſgreſs'd with him. The ſame alſo he delivers with as much or more eloquence in his Enchiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion; for ſearching out the cauſe of ſo many evils that aſſault us, he concludes that the ſinne of our firſt father is the originall thereof, and that we are therefore criminall and miſerable, becauſe we are a part of him. Thence it comes to paſſe, ſaith he, that being baniſhed out of Paradiſe after his tranſgreſſion, he was condemned to death with all his Poſterity, who living in him as in their Principle, were infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with his prevarication, as the branches wither in their ſtock, and die in their root. Thence it comes to paſſe that all children that deſcend from him, and from his wife, the Complice of his offence and of his puniſhment, are the heirs of his corruption. This ſinne paſſeth into them by the channell of concupiſcence, and makes them ſenſible of a torment which ſeems the image of their diſobedience, ſince one part of themſelves is revolted againſt the other: This revolt engaging their ſoule in vanity, and their body in pain; leads them inſenſibly with the rebellious Angels to that laſt Judgement which will never have an end.</p>
                  <p>Let us give a little light to this Speculation, let us amplifie in this diſcourſe what Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath wrapt up in this paſſage; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding all the evils derived from ſinne, diſcover the malignant influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of this Delinquent in chiefe upon his wretched members. Ignorance ſeems to be one of the prime calamities of man; 'Tis born with him ever ſince he was born with ſinne; it ſinks ſo deep into his ſoule, that it cannot be expell'd thence but with labour and pain. Children know neither their Creatour, nor their Father; they live ſome years in this ſad condition: we muſt expect till Nature ripen their ſenſes, and make them capable of the inſtructions of their Nurſes or Maſters, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and truth may paſſe into their ſoules by the mediation of their eyes and eares. Thoſe that are born among infidels, thinking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves from ignorance, are plung'd into falſhood, and fall into a miſchiefe more grievous then that they labour to avoid; when theſe two evils are aſſociated together, they heighten the bad inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115672:60"/>of the Will; of an offender they make an Opinator, and adding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy to malice, throw him into a neceſſity of ſinning.</p>
                  <p>If it have not this unhappy conſequence in the faithfull, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the School of Truth, it occaſions another, whoſe effects are no whit leſſe tragicall. For the Will feels a wretched impotency towards all thoſe good things, the combate of vices, and the conqueſt of vertues, makes him apprehend; ſhe complains that what ever is enjoyn'd is harſh and difficult; what ever is forbidden, eaſie and delightfull; and having no ſtrength to ſecure her ſelfe againſt griefe and pleaſure,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>But that which is moſt deplorable, Concupiſcence that ſo diſables for good, raiſeth their appetite with ſo ſtrong a propenſity to evill, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeems difficult that appears under that notion. The ambitious ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with pleaſure thoſe great anxieties that accompany Glory; this vain Idol makes them ſo couragious that they are true to it to the laſt gaſp; their conſtancy imitates that of Martyrs, and they endure more hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to conquer a Province, then thoſe generous Champions have to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Heaven. The Covetous make our Penitentiaries bluſh; their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt coſts them more then our Salvation; Paſſion that ſwallows them up, exerciſeth ſo cruell a Tyranny over their wills, that it obliges them to all the painfull ſeverities the love of Jeſus Chriſt diſciplin'd the <hi>Anchorites</hi> to. They faſt to ſave charges, they watch for lucre, they leave their Countrey to traffique, they venture their lives to aſſure their gains, and loſe their conſcience to enrich their houſe. Finally,

                        <hi>Haec cupiditas vana, ac per hoc prava vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit in eis ac fraenat alias cupiditates.</hi> Aug.</note> Concupiſcence works as many diſorders in ſinners, as Charity does good in Martyrs; it inſpires them with vigour in tickling them with love; it ſheds a poiſon into their ſouls, which blending weakneſſe with ſtrength, makes them ſo unable for any good, that the leaſt difficulty that accompanies it aſtoniſheth them; and ſo valiant for evill, that the greateſt oppoſitions that attend it, raiſe their courage to compaſſe it. To all theſe miſchiefs might be added the diviſion of the ſoule and body, the revolt of the paſſions againſt reaſon, the treachery of the ſenſes in reſpect of the underſtanding, and all the diſtempers that ariſe from the unſeaſonableneſſe of the weather, or the ſtrife of the Elements, had I not largely deſcrib'd them in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the miſeries of man a Criminall: But not to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tedious repetitions, 'tis more uſefull to conſider the Head from whence we have derived our Benedictions; and confront him againſt the other, from whom we have received our Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>themaes.</p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:115672:61"/>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt is that glorious CHIEF whom the Eternall Father is pleaſed to engraffe upon our Nature, to deliver it from thoſe miſeries it grones under; 'tis from Him that all our advantages flow; and as we are made guilty by deſcending from <hi>Adam,</hi> we become innocent by being planted into JESUS CHRIST: Our Redemption holds ſome proportion with our Fall; the Mercy of God is regulated by his Juſtice, and the Grace he beſtowes upon us is a copy of our chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The firſt Man (ſaith Saint <hi>Augustine</hi>) received a Liberty void of all ſervitude; God preſented him with Fire and Water, and gave him leave to chuſe; Man took Fire, and rejected the Water; God, who is juſt, let him graſp what he had choſen, ſo that hee was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unhappy becauſe he would be ſo: See here an Expreſſe of the <hi>Justice</hi> of God; Turn the Table, and behold one of his <hi>Mercy:</hi> For ſeeing that Man, by the bad uſe of his Free-will, had corrupted all Mankinde in his Perſon, He came down from heaven, not tarrying for his prayers, and healed him by his Humility, who had loſt himſelf by his Pride; he rectified the wanderers, and put them into the right way; hee call'd home the Baniſhed, and inſtated them in their Country, that they might no longer glory in themſelves, but in that immaculate CHIEF from whom they derived their ſalvation. This Verity is the Foundation of our Religion; The beliefe of two <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> acquaints us with our Fall, and with our Recovery: Wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know what we owe JESUS CHRIST, unleſſe we know what we loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> nor can we ever worthily comprehend the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have to our Redeemer, unleſſe we fully underſtand all the misfortunes accru'd to us by him that was our Parricide, at the ſame inſtant that he was our Parent. Therefore is it that the great Apoſtle never ſeparates ADAM from JESUS CHRIST; he always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Grace againſt Sin; be heightens the greatneſs of the Remedy, by that of the Diſeaſe: and that we may have a right eſtimate of the children of God, he minds us, that they were the children of wrath, and veſſels of diſhonour. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (the faithfull Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) admirably explains this Myſtery, in commenting upon the words of this Apoſtle. <q>As none (ſaith he) enters into the kingdom of Death, that paſſeth not by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Maxime is ſo true, that man makes no more progreſſe in perfection, then according as he doth in allyance with Jeſus Chriſt:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115672:61"/>The more Faith he hath, the leſſe hath he of Errour and Falſhood; the more hope he conceives in the mercy of God, the leſſe confidence hath he in the favour of men; the more he burns with the fire of Charity, the leſſe is he ſcorched with the flames of Concupiſcence; the more he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this innocent and glorious Head, from whom all grace is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the leſſe is he fixt to that infamous and criminall Head, from whom all ſin takes it originall; ſo that Chriſtians, as we have already proved, ought to have no other care but to make <hi>Adam</hi> die, and Jeſus Chriſt live in their perſon; if they intend to be innocent, they muſt be Parricides; if they will beſtow life upon the Son of God, they muſt inflict death upon their firſt Father; if they meane to be quickned with the ſpirit of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which raiſeth men in debaſing them, they muſt renounce the ſpirit of vain-glory, which lays men low in lifting them up, and under a colour of making Gods of them, makes them nothing but Devils or Beaſts. Finally, mans unhappineſſe flows from the ſhamefull alliance he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Birth,
<note place="margin">

Thus the quality of a Chief in <hi>Adam</hi> is the ſource of all our Evils; and the quality of a Chief in Jeſus Chriſt, is the Originall of all our Good; and as <hi>Adam</hi> did not ſo much deſtroy us in being our Father, as in being our Head: neither doth Jeſus Chriſt ſave us ſo much for being his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren or his Children, as becauſe we are his members; becauſe 'tis in effect, this quality that procures us all the reſt; neither is God our Father, but becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is our Head.</p>

God ſaith he, could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow no higher honour upon men then by uniting them with his Word, by whom he created all things, as the Members with their Head; that he that was the Son of God, might be the Sonne of Man; and that by reaſon of his Divine Perſon ſubſiſting in the Humane Nature, he might be God with his Father, and Man with his Brethren. 'Tis in effect from this glorious co-habitation that all our bleſſings are derived: If the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon us, 'tis becauſe we are the Members of his onely Sonne; If he hear our prayers, 'tis becauſe Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks by our mouth; if he receive us into Glory, 'tis becauſe he ſees us cloathed with the merits of our Head; if he admit us into his boſome, 'tis becauſe the quality we bear renders us inſeparable from his Word; But if this alliance be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to Chriſtians, 'tis honourable to Jeſus Chriſt; For though nothing can be added to his Grandeur, who is equall to his Father, and all the Priviledges he received from his Incarnation, may paſſe for ſo many Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations: Nevertheleſſe the dignity of being Head of the Church is ſo eminent, that after that of the Son of God, there is none ſo Venerable and Auguſt. It gives Jeſus Chriſt the ſame advantage over the Faithfull, that the Head hath over the Members; and to conceive what he is in the Church, we muſt obſerve what this is in the Body.</p>
                  <p>The Head is the nobleſt ſeat of the Soul, 'tis that part of the Body where ſhe acts her higheſt operations; 'tis there that ſhe debates thoſe ſubjects that are preſented to her, that ſhe deliberates upon the accidents that happen: 'tis there that the memory preſerves the ſpecies, which may be called the treaſures of wiſdome, and the riches of the Intellectuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; 'tis there that the underſtanding conceives truths, and the will pronounceth determinations: In a word, 'tis there that the affairs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Peace and Warre, Salvation or Damnation, Time or Eternity, are treated of; Thus alſo is it in Ieſus Chriſt, that all thoſe lights reſide that govern the Church; 'tis in him that are ſhut up all the treaſures of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and from him that all Oracles proceed whereby the Faithfull are inſtructed.</p>
                  <p>The Head is the moſt eminent part of the Body; Nature was willing that as it is the nobleſt, ſo it ſhould be placed neareſt Heaven; and the very ſituation ſhould oblige all the other parts to ſhew it reverence: It is the moſt exalted, that it may more eaſily diſpence its orders, and that the ſpirits which convey ſenſe and motion by the nerves, may deſcend with more facility into all the parts of the body. Ieſus Chriſt alſo is in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115672:62"/>higheſt place of his State, he reignes in Heaven with his Father, from thence he views all the neceſſities of his Body, he ſends thoſe influences that are needfull to every particular member, diſtributing light and heat accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own deſignes and their neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>The Head is the moſt illuſtrious throne of the Soul; ſhe hath all the ſenſes for ornament or for defence; The Ears ſerve as Scouts which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly report whatever the confuſion of noiſes, or diſtinction of voices can inform either doubtfull or certain: The Eyes are faithfull Guides, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Eſſence of things, by diſcovering the accidents under which they are veiled; The Palate is the taſter of meats, judgeth of good and bad, and following the orders of his Soveraign, receives the one and rejects the other; The Noſe is not only the unloader of the Brain, and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of the Face, but the ſeat of ſmelling, and diſcerns of ſents; that as the Head is the Queen Regent of the Body, ſhe may have all things neceſſary for the preſervation of her Subjects. Thus may we ſay that the Son of God poſſeſſes all the Graces that are diſperſed amongſt the Faithful; that he hath all the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, which are as the ſenſes of the Myſtical Body, and includes all the vertues that ſerve either for the ornament or defence of his members.

                  <p>If this wonderfull Chief have ſome priviledges common with the Head, he hath others that are particular, and which force us to confeſſe that hee is much nobler then that goodly part that commands all the reſt: For the Head can neither be younger nor elder then the Body; Nature forms them both together, and at the ſame time that ſhe lengthens the arm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Shoulders, faſtens the Legs, ſhe opens the Eyes, boars the Ears, faſhions the Noſe and pefects the Head: But Ieſus Chriſt is Independent of his Members; he was born at the very inſtant he choſe with his Father; and as he quickens his Body before his Birth, ſo doth he after his Death: All the Faithfull that were before him, lived by the Grace they drew from him; and all that come after him, live now by the influences they receive from his Sacred Perſon: He acted in the world, before he came into the world; He ſanctified the Patriarchs, of whom he was to be born; He inanimated thoſe Kings that were his Anceſtors; and contrary to all the orders of Nature, he gave life to thoſe from whom he was to receive it. We cannot deny but his Grace was more powerfull in this particular, then the ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> for this wretched Parent communicated not his poiſon but to thoſe that deſcended from him; he made none but his children
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115672:63"/>heirs of his misfortune; and whoever ſprang not from that unfortunate ſtock, may boaſt himſelf innocent. But the Son of God acts indifferently upon all men; his power is not bounded by Ages; the Future depends upon him as well as the Paſt; and the Saints that ſaw the Deluge of the world, owe their grace to him, as well as thoſe that ſhall ſee the Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: He hath this advantage common to him with thoſe cauſes which act before they are; and being the laſt in execution, ceaſe not to operate, becauſe they are the firſt in intention. Thus the Son of God produceth wonders at the birth and at the diſſolution of Ages, though he were not born till the fulneſs of time, becauſe he is the firſt in the intention of his Father: the Faithful are but for him; and all the Elect are the Members which make up that Body whereof he is the Head.

                  <p>This circumſtance greatly magnifies the power of Jeſus Chriſt, and makes us ſee that the treaſures of his merits are infinite, in that he is not onely unable to be exhauſted by all the Faithful that are enriched by him, but becauſe his liberality was laid open from the beginning of the world. The Kings of the earth act not but during their life; if they exerciſe ſome deſires in the hearts of their Subjects before their death, they are blinde velleities, which are many times attended with repentance and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: if they leave ſome regret after their death, it is quickly buried by the vices or vertues of their Succeſſors: and when we no longer feel the benefit of their Protection, we are no longer mindful of their Perſons. But Jeſus, more powerful and more neceſſary then Monarchs, acted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Birth, and after his Reſurrection:
<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>His Power was increaſed by his Death: that which ruines the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Princes, ſerved onely to eſtabliſh his Kingdom: he was never more abſolute then upon the Croſs; and that head crowned with thorns, was never more active then when he ſtood at bay: This Sun never darted forth more rays, then when he was in an eclipſe; nor did the Son of God ever ſo gloriouſly triumph over his enemies, as when they upbraided him with his weakneſs, and rejoyced at his ſufferings. Then was it that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:115672:63"/>the Church in his wounds, that he gave his children life by his own death, that he encouraged his Apoſtles to Martyrdom; and providing Graces for all his Members, inſpired them with ſtrength to vanquiſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſubdue grief. For though the Son of God be the Head of men in all the conditions of life, becauſe he was ſo before his birth; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he exerciſeth this Office in a time when others cannot:
<note place="margin">Hodie mecum eris in Paradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: <hi>Excedit humanum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem iſta promiſſio, nec tam de ligno Crucis quàm de Throno editur poteſtatis.</hi> Leo.</note> He founded his Church in dying; he acted like a Soveraigne, when they deprived him of life: he pardoned offenders, when they handled him as a delinquent: he diſpoſed of the kingdom of heaven, when they diſputed his kingdom upon earth; and making his power appear in his weakneſs, his innocence in his execution, and his grandeur in his affronts, he takes pleaſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the pride of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>But me thinks there is no quality makes him ſhine forth with ſo much pomp upon the Croſs, as that of being the Head: For beſides that it was in this place that he offered up himſelf for his Elect, and by bonds as ſtrong as they are ſecret, united them to his Perſon, that neither ſin nor death can ever ſeparate them from him; it was there that he made that wonderful Bargain with them, where charging himſelf with their ſins, he inveſted them with his merits; and taking upon him the quality of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, communicated to them that of innocents. There it was that he eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Church; and accompliſhing that Figure which preceded in the perſon of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he was willing to die, that his Spouſe might live. For the holy Scripture, not without a Myſtery, obſerves that <hi>Eve</hi> was taken from the ſide of <hi>Adam</hi> whilſt he was aſleep, that all the world might know that the Church muſt proceed from the ſide of Chriſt when he hung dead upon the Croſs. God could, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the woman of her husband whilſt he was awake, had there not been ſome Myſtery couched under that Ceremony; for if we ſay God choſe that time to rid man from all ſenſe of pain, it was too violent not to awaken him: and if we ſay man felt it not, becauſe God wrought the work, he could as eaſily have taken away the rib when he was awake, as when he lay aſleep: But he had a minde to expreſs that in Paradiſe, which was to be acted upon mount Calvary; and teach us, that as <hi>Eve</hi> iſſued from the ſide of her ſleeping husband, the Church ſhould iſſue from the ſide of dying Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>If this Myſtery heightens the love and power of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt confeſs it augments withal the obligations Chriſtians have to death and ſufferings. For Chriſt conceived us in the midſt of his wounds; we are the children of his ſorrows; and his Church coſt him much more pain and trouble then <hi>Eve</hi> did the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi>

But Jeſus loſt his life, to beſtow it upon the Church; his body muſt be opened, and his heart pierced, to form his Bride: this Maid was to be ſought for in the bowels of her Father; and an inciſion made into the ſide of the Parent, to be the Midwife to this <hi>Poſthuma.</hi> As this Quality was dear bought, and like <hi>David</hi> he was fain to mingle his own blood with that of the Philiſtims, to purchaſe his Church, his minde is, that the children of ſo dolorous a Marriage breathe nothing but ſufferings; and remembring that they are the babes of a God dying upon the Croſs, they ſhould paſs their whole life in ſorrow and tribulations: For, what likelihood is there, that, being born in pain and anguiſh, they ſhould ſeek after delights and pleaſure?

                  <p>ALl Polititians acknowledge that the Soveraign, being the Head of the State, is united with his Subjects; and that their union is ſo neer, that their intereſts are in common: He that offends the Prince, wrongs the State: he that attempts any thing againſt his ſacred Perſon, wounds all thoſe that live in his Kingdom: and as Nature teacheth all members to expoſe themſelves for the preſervation of their head, the Politicks teach all Subjects to venture themſelves for the defence of their Soveraign. But foraſmuch as the obligations are mutual and reciprocal, the ſame Politicks read a Lecture to Kings, that they are bound to preſerve their Subjects, to ſpare their blood, and to handle offenders as corrupted members, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115672:64"/>are never cut off from the body but with ſorrow and neceſſity. The Prince muſt be ſenſible of every part of his State that periſheth; every blowe that lights upon it, pierceth his heart: and his love towards it muſt be ſuch, that he be ready to lay down his life for them, when he ſhall judge their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to depend upon his death. This is the reaſon <hi>Seneca</hi> ſometimes made uſe of to ſweeten the cruel humour of <hi>Nero,</hi> and to inſtil clemency into the heart of that bloody Parricide. Thou, ſaid he, art the head of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; whence thou mayſt gheſs how neceſſary Clemency is to thee, ſince in pardoning others, thou art pitiful to thy ſelf; and favouring thy ſubjects, art kinde to him that lives in them as in his members. If we believe this Philoſopher, there was a time when <hi>Nero</hi> profited by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and this Truth had ſo powerful an impreſſion upon his ſpirit, that he was witty to finde out pretences to ſpare the blood of delinquents: For, to uſe <hi>Seneca</hi>'s own words; When there came an offender before him who was yet in the flower of his age, he pardoned his youth,

                  <p>Though all this Diſcourſe make it evident, that there is no ſtricter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation then that between Kings and their Subjects; yet muſt we confeſs 'tis rather Imaginary then Veritable: For, beſides that experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that Kings, who live in pleaſure, ſeldom think of the miſeries of their People; Reaſon inſtructs us, that there is nothing but Nature or Grace that can unite men to one another. All thoſe Alliances that are founded onely upon Inclinations or Duty, ſtamp no Character; and if Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſecond not the Politicks, they can neither oblige Subjects to expoſe their lives for the ſafety of their Prince, nor Princes for that of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Whatever Oracles Morality pronounceth upon this occaſion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Colours Eloquence adorns the actions of Souldiers with who have ſpilt their blood for the honour of their Soveraigns, they never lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as their Head: and if they ſet upon their enemies in ſpight of the thunder of the Canon, 'twas not ſo much for the preſervation of their Perſon, as out of a hope of Glory, or expectation of a Reward. There is no true Alliance, but that which is eſtabliſhed upon the Fleſh, or upon the Spirit: and among ſo many Chiefs that govern their States, there is none but Jeſus Chriſt that is really united with his Subjects: He lives in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:115672:65"/>them by Grace; and as Faith and Charity are able to make him preſent in all his members, it is ſufficient to be Faithfull or Charitable, to make up one part of his Myſticall Body.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſſe, that he ſhares with his members in all the Good or Evill they receive; that his Glory hinders him not from having a fellow-feeling of their miſeries; and though in Heaven, yet ceaſeth not to ſuffer with them upon Earth. The diſtance of place disjoyns him not from his Myſticall Body; he is with men, though among the Angels; and this Bridegroom that reigns with the Church Triumphant, fights yet with the Militant. Theſe two Churches make up his Spouſe; he loves them both as one; he gives himſelf to both of them, not imitating the Saints who leaving their aſhes to the Church Militant, tranſlate their ſouls to the Church Triumphant; he imparts himſelf to both without being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to either; and to take away all ſhadow of jealouſie, reſides as truly among the Faithfull,

                  <p>We ſee alſo in the Scripture, that he is ſenſible of all the outrages that are done to his members; and that from Heaven above where he reigns, with the Angels, he ſuffers with the Faithfull upon the earth. When <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted the Infant Church, endeavouring to ſtiffle it in the Cradle; when rage in his heart, threats in his mouth, arms in his hands, ſent him to make inquiſition after her tender ones from Jeruſalem as far as <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> the Son of God complains of this violence, as if done againſt his own Perſon; and the neer relation he hath contracted with them, obliged him to profeſſe that in offending them, they wounded him: <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Jeſus Chriſt had ſufficiently honoured the Faithfull, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> had he been contented to call them his Friends or his Brethren, and one ſo glorious a condition had ſhrowded them from the rage and fury of ſo cruell a perſecutor; but he had prejudiced his love and his veracity, had he uſed other terms: Being the Head of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and happily affianced to them, he muſt of neceſſity mingle their injuries with his; and to aggravate the greatneſſe of this outrage, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him that was the Authour, that no man could offend the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but he muſt wound him; nor hurt men, but he muſt injure the only Son of God. Let us hear Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> upon this Subject, and ſee how he handles this myſtery of Unity. Jeſus Chriſt was in Heaven when hee

Meant he to imitate the pride of thoſe ambitious Angels, that ſet upon him in the midſt of his Glory? <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuced the Chriſtians, and not Ieſus Chriſt that reigned with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven: But becauſe he lived in the Faithfull, he ſuffered with his members, and eſtabliſhed that Maxime which this Apoſtle was one day to preach; <hi>If one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it:</hi> he uſes this language to <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſpeaks to him with an Emphaſis, <hi>Why doeſt thou perſecute me?</hi> The glory wherewith I am ſurrounded, renders thy attempts fruitleſſe; and whatever hatred thou haſt conceived againſt me, thou canſt not injure my Greatneſſe: Know nevertheſſe, that I live ſtill in my Faithfull ones; that they are my members; that I am their Head; and that in perſecuting them, thou perſecuteſt me in their perſon. Ought not this my Brethren to aſtoniſh you? goes on Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> ſeeing the ſame thing happens to us every day, and an ordinary and familiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample evidenceth the ſame truth; For when ye are in the throng of an Aſſembly, and ſome body treads upon your foot, your tongue preſently complains: and though no body toucht it, cries out, you have hurt me; what means it by that expreſſion? Might it not be replyed, you are in ſafety; the place you have in the body, ſecures you from danger: and if any part be offended, 'tis the foot, not you. In the mean time Truth and Charity require this language; for being in the ſame body with the foot, their good and bad are common; he that hurts one, hurts the other; the ſociety that unites them, and the compaſſion that grows from their ſociety, conſtraines it to utter the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Let us apply this compariſon, and ſay, though Ieſus Chriſt ſuffer not in his Perſon, he ſuffers in that of the Faithfull; that making up one body with them, he is ſenſible of their pains; and taking part in their wrongs, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended when any one offends them.</p>
                  <p>By the ſame conſequence, a Chriſtian can doe no good to other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but the Son or God is beholding to him for it: For the Felicity he enjoyeth, exempts him from all want; nothing can be added to his riches by deſires, and he is ſo great and ſo happy, that there is nothing he can either hope or fear: yet is he indigent in the faithfull, and he may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the perſon of the miſerable; he proteſts that in that terrible day when he will examine the good and bad works of his Subjects, he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the good offices done to the poor, as done to himſelf; nor will make any difference between the good uſage he received in his naturall body, and that he ſhall have received in his myſticall body; he will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounce ſentence upon theſe different actions, and every where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Head with the Members, will puniſh with as much ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe that have perſecuted him in the poor, as thoſe that nailed him
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115672:66"/>to the Croſſe: <hi>That which yee did to one of the leaſt of mine, yee did unto me.</hi> This truth ought to comfort the good, and ſtrike terrour into the wicked: For if Ieſus Chriſt live ſtill in the diſtreſſed; if the condition of a Head, which he preſerves in Glory, make him languiſh in the poor, we muſt needs conclude that thoſe that oppreſſe them, are as guilty as the Phariſees that oppreſſed Jeſus Chriſt; Though his Innocence was clouded under the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh, and the luſtre of his Majeſty obſcured by the humility of his perſon; his enemies did deſpite to a God when they thought only to injure a Man, they committed a Parricide when they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined they acted only a murder; and the Father puniſheth them as guilty of Treaſon againſt the Divine Majeſty, becauſe the miracles of his Sonne took away all pretence from their zeal, and all excuſe from their offence: The ſame judgement threatens thoſe that perſecute the poor; For though nothing of worth ſhine forth in them that can render them conſiderable; though Ieſus be hid under the miſery of their condition, and reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcover a happy man under an unfortunate one; nor a Son of God under a child of <hi>Adam;</hi> he will not fail to puniſh them as ſeverely as thoſe that knew him not in <hi>Judea,</hi> becauſe his words which are to be reſpected as Oracles, ſuffer us not to doubt of this verity which makes up one of the chiefeſt Articles of our Faith.</p>
                  <p>But if it be an argument of terrour to the wicked, 'tis a ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation to the godly; For they may ſtill ſuccour the Son of God in wretched and diſtreſſed people; they may imitate the piety of <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> they may enjoy the priviledges which make up the glory of thoſe bleſſed women; they may ſtill be the entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Ieſus Chriſt; and receiving him in the perſon of the poor and ſtrangers,

There, by a ſtrange prodigie, Fleſh and Spirit agree with Divinity; neither are the two Others ſwallowed up in This: Each Nature preſerves its rights; and as the ſoul is not debas'd by being engaged in the Fleſh, the Divinity is not diſparaged by being aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to both: This ſhines forth by Miracles, the Other Two are obſcured by Injuries: In a word, the Son of God never loſeth his Equality with his Father, nor the Son of Man his Equality with his Mother. The third Unity is that of the Body, which is found between Chriſt and his Church: for though there be ſo much difference between theſe two Perſons, Love hath combined them ſo neer together, that not confounding their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he hath made there of but one Body whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the Head, and the Faithful the Members: They live of one and the ſame Spirit; their Intereſts are common: though one raign triumphantly in heaven, the other ſuffer miſerably upon earth, they fail not to be ſo perfectly knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that the Body is happie in the Head, and the Head is afflicted in the Members. Of theſe Three admirable Unities, the Second adores the Firſt, and the Third the Second: For the principal deſigne of the Word in his Incarnation, is, to honour the Trinity of the Divine Perſons by the Trinity of his Natures, and to pay homage to the Unity of the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by the Unity of his Perſon. This Divine Compound is an Image of the Trinity: it declares the wonders thereof by its conſtitution; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he take pleaſure to unite the Fleſh and the Spirit with the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but to expreſs to the Faithful the ineffable Unity between the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, in the difference of their perſonal proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Indeed this incomprehenſible Myſtery was not preached among the children of men, till the Word became Incarnate; and their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clarified with the light of Faith, began not to conceive the Trinity of the Perſons in the Unity of the Divine Eſſence, till it conceived the Trinity of the Natures in the Unity of the Perſon of the Word. Finally, the Third Unity renders honour to the Second, ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt entred not into ſociety with his Church, but in purſuance of the affinity he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with Humane Nature. It ſeems he was willing to extend the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Incarnation, in that he made all men his Members, to make them the children of God; and not being able, or not vouchſafing to unite himſelf perſonally with every Chriſtian, he became united to them in the unity of the Spirit and of the Body. The Firſt of theſe Marriages is the example of the Second; and we cannot well expreſs the Union of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt with his Church, but by that of the Word with our Nature. The Reſemblances are ſo wonderful, that they juſtly deſerve this Diſcourſe, to ſee if we can clear them.</p>
                  <p>The chiefeſt ſecret of this myſtery, is, that the Plurality of Nature de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys

But in theſe different conditions he ceaſeth not to be one and the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who accommodating himſelf to the proprieties of his Natures, mixes Greatneſs with Humility, Joy with Sorrow, Repentance with Innocence, without intereſſing his Perſon. The ſame wonder is met with in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of Chriſt with his Church: they are different in their qualities; and 'tis a ſtrange effect of Love, that was able to finde out a means to unite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether two ſubjects whoſe conditions are ſo diſſonant: The one is Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, becauſe God; the other a ſlave, becauſe redeemed: the one inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, the other guilty; the one reigns in Eternity, the other ſighs and groans in Time: nevertheleſs their Union is ſo ſtrict, that, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding their properties, they compoſe one and the ſame Body, and both together make up but one onely Jeſus Chriſt.

Jeſus Chriſt, then, and the Church, make up but one Body; and both of them together make that admirable Compound, which, by reaſon of the difference of its parts, bears ſometimes the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſometimes the name of the Church.</p>
                  <p>This leads us to the ſecond Reſemblance between the Union of the Humanity with the Divinity, and that of Jeſus Chriſt with the Faithful: For the former is ſo perfect, that without offending the two Natures that ſubſiſt in the Word, all that may be ſaid of the one, which is ſaid of the other. The Communication of Properties, produceth that of Idiomes; and, without uttering blaſphemies, we attribute to Man all that may be attributed to God. Thus, without doing any violence to Truth, we ſay, that God is Man, and that Man is God; that Man commands over Death, that God is ſubject to the dominion thereof; that Man contains the whole world in his Innocency, and that God is incloſed in the chaſte womb of a Virgin; that Man bears rule with his Father, and that God obeys with his Mother. All theſe manners of ſpeech, which elſe had been blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, are now great Verities: and as if the Word had been willing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the unjuſt paſſion of Man that deſired to be God, he hath exalted him to his Greatneſs, in uniting him to his Perſon; and by priviledge hath
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115672:68"/>conferred that upon him by Grace, which by Nature he was no ways able to attain unto. Such is the Union of Jeſus Chriſt with his Church: the communication of their Goods, hath produced the communication of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects: we ſpeak of them ſo confuſedly, that there are no Elogies given to Jeſus Chriſt, which may not be given to his Spouſe: he loads himſelf with her ſins, and cloathes her with his merits; he gives her part of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and covers himſelf with her unrighteouſneſs: ſo that without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicing the Greatneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Modeſty of the Church, we may ſay, The Church is perfect in her Head, and the Head imperfect in his Members; the Church knows all things in her Head, and Jeſus Chriſt learns in his Members; the Church is innocent in her Head, and Jeſus Chriſt guilty in his Members. Thus is it that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> interprets the words of the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Deus, Deus meus, ut quid me dereliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti? <hi>Quare hoc dicitur, nifi quia nos ibi eramus, niſi quia corpus Chriſti Eccleſia? quomodo dicit delictorum meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, niſi quia pro delictis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris ipſe preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; delict a noſtra ſua fecit ut juftitiam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram ſuam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret?</hi> Aug. in Pſal. 24.

Indeed becauſe he is the Head of the Church, and this quality unites him with his Members, it obliges him to ſpeak of their ſins as of his own, to pay thoſe debts for them he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contracted, and in their name to ſatisfie the juſtice of his Father he had no ways offended. How, ſaith the ſame S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> could Jeſus Chriſt make this diſcourſe without wounding his Innocence and Truth it ſelf? How could he attribute ſins to himſelf, that never committed any? How can we believe him true, when he made his confeſſion upon the Croſs, were it not that we acknowledge he applied our offences to himſelf, that he might communicate our righteouſneſs to him; and by the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Head and the Members, he is charged with our Crimes, to enrich us with his Merits?</p>
                  <p>This will not ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that ſhall conſider another paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between the Marriage of the Humanity with the Divinity, and that of Jeſus Chriſt with the Church: For though Joy and Sorrow be as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible as Sin and Innocence, ſince, according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> man became not miſerable, till he became criminal; we obſerve nevertheleſs both of them in the Perſon of the Son of God, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment of his Incarnation: he joyned pain with pleaſure during the courſe of his whole life: he taſted the felicity of Angels, and reſented the miſeries of men: he is happie and afflicted; and, contrary to all the laws of Nature and Grace, a glorious ſoul informs a paſſive body; and that which beholds the Divine Eſſence,
<note place="margin">Triſtis eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mea uſque ad mortem.</note> is obliged to make complaints and ſhed tears. Therefore is it that I have always reverenced that Ancient who call'd Jeſus Chriſt a Paradox, becauſe his compoſition ſtartles Humane Reaſon, aſſociating in his Perſon Joy and Grief, Innocence and Guilt; in a word, the Majeſtie of a God, with the Weakneſs of a Man. But inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this Myſtery was unconceiveable, becauſe hid, Jeſus Chriſt was willing to manifeſt it by the union he contracted with the Church: For there may be ſeen an Image or Repreſentation of that which paſſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:115672:68"/>in the perſon of the Son of God: pleaſure may be obſerved with pain; and by a ſtrange wonder,

                  <p>Finally, to conclude theſe Reſemblances, the Word uniting it ſelf to the Humanity, ſtoops to exalt it; and enters into its Imperfections, to give it admittance into his Power. For though the Manhood remain in its natural condition, yet was it adorned with ſo many Graces by this ſacred Marriage, that it became happily acceptable, and found it ſelf in a free neceſſity to love God, without being able to offend him; it appeared ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified as ſoon as conceived, glorious as ſoon as reaſonable; and by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge which neither Men nor Angels ſhall ever enjoy, it was no ſooner drawn out of Nothing, but was united to the Eternal Word. Theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles would remain without an Example, did we not perceive ſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows thereof in the conjunction of Jeſus Chriſt with the Church: For, in chuſing her for his Spouſe, he hath endowed her with all the advantages ſo noble an Alliance could exact: he hath made her worthy of his Love, from the very firſt moment he began to love her; and more powerful then thoſe Bridegrooms who can onely advantage thoſe they love in riches or honours, he hath adorned her with all the graces her dignity could require, or her condition ſuffer: For if ſhe be not yet glorious in all her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if ſhe ſigh in the Poor, be a captive in the Priſoner, 'tis becauſe the Land of dying mortals where ſhe lives, is not capable of all the priviledges of her Bridegroom; yet may ſhe boaſt, that ſhe poſſeſſeth in her Head what ſhe wants in her Body; taſtes that in the Bleſſed, which ſhe cannot taſte in the Faithful; and if ſhe be Militant upon Earth, is Triumphant in Heaven. But nothing ſo much advanceth the Graces ſhe hath received from Jeſus Chriſt, as the offences ſhe committed during her Infidelity. For ſhe broke her word in the firſt of her children; ſhe liſtened to the promiſes of the Serpent by the ear of our firſt mother; ſhe erected Altars to devils by the hands of Idolaters; ſhe uttered blaſphemies by the mouth of Libertines; ſhe had committed as many Adulteries, as ſhe had ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Falſe Deities; and her crimes emboſs'd one upon another, had bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her with the ignominious titles of Perfidiouſneſs, Adultery, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence. In the mean time, her Beloved forgave her all theſe faults, wip'd away all her ſpots in the Laver of Baptiſm; and making her a Bath of his own Blood, returned her at the ſame time Holineſs, Innocence, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But as his Power is equal to his Love, he undertook a thing that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never durſt attempt: For finding her, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in her proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, he reſtored her her Purity; of an Adultreſs, he made her a Virgin;

Theſe two Bodies have ſo much affinity, that 'tis hard to judge which of them Jeſus Chriſt loves beſt; and their priviledges ſo like, that 'tis eaſily perceived they belong both to one God. For beſides that they are both formed by the Holy Ghoſt, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that conceived them, ceaſe not to be pure; notwithſtanding they are pregnant, they enjoy the ſame favours, and are equally precious to the Son of God: His Naturall Body by time received its full growth, though he were perfect at the moment of conception; he was ſo little, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Faith could comprehend him to be the Temple of the Eternall Word; his Members were faſhioned in the ſpace of nine moneths; the naturall heat enlarged and fortified them, and the nouriſhment they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, gave them that juſt proportion Children ought to have at their Birth. It was no ſmall proof of the Humility of Ieſus Chriſt, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that he was willing to condeſcend to the Laws of Nature, and waving his abſolute power, expect with patience till his members were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115672:69"/>to be born in the fulneſſe of time.

Sometimes he ſees the <hi>Sauls</hi> become part of that whole they have endeavoured to deſtroy; Sometimes he receives <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> and drawing them from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to Truth, makes them his Diſciples and his Members; Sometimes he converts other ſinners, and aſſociating them to his Perſon with himſelf, compleats his Church. 'Tis true, as this Body is much greater then the Naturall, there is required much more time to give it its ultimate perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: The Naturall was accompliſhed in twenty five years; it had all its bigneſſe when 'rwas nailed to the Croſſe, neither was any thing wanting to that Maſter-piece of the Holy Ghoſt, but Glory, which was deferred till the Reſurrection, becauſe it had hindered the work of our Salvation: But the Myſticall commenced with the world; nor ſhall end but with that Fabrick: <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were the firſt parts; the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Apoſtles and the Faithfull continue it; and the laſt predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, ſhall accompliſh it at the end of the world. Its full meaſure ſhall not be till the generall Reſurrection, and there will ſomething ſtill bee wanting to its perfection, till the number of the Elect be compleated.</p>
                  <p>The Naturall Body could not grow, but all the members muſt grow with it: For there is ſuch a Harmony in mans body, that nature travels at the ſame time to perfect the whole <hi>Compoſitum:</hi> The nouriſhment turned into blood, paſſeth through the veins to the remoteſt parts; one and the ſame matter takes a thouſand different forms; and the ſame ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment changeth the qualities, that it may equally ſupply the needs of all the members. Jeſus Chriſt was ſubject to theſe Laws whileſt he lived among men; the meat he eat, aſſimilated into his ſubſtance; every part took what was needfull for it; and whileſt his hands that were to work ſo many miracles were ſtrengthned, his legs that were to bear him over all <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> were alike fixed and conſolidated. 'Tis ſo with his Myſticall Body; the parts that compoſe it, grow according to their employments; they take their bulk and nouriſhment from his Word, and from his Grace; nothing remains uſeleſſe in that great Body; every particular haſtens to perfection, and in the difference of conditions, all the members receive their growth and dimenſion. This is it that the Apoſtle had a minde to acquaint us with by thoſe words, which being well underſtood, will great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve to the clearing of this myſtery: <hi>Speaking the truth in love, let us grow in him thorough all things, who is the Head Chriſt;</hi> From whence we learn, that we grow not in our ſelves, but as much as we grow in Jeſus Chriſt; and that 'tis from the union we contract with him, that our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfection is derived.</p>

                  <p>Both theſe Bodies were a Sacrifice to God; aſſoon as Ieſus Chriſt was Incarnate, he immolated himſelf to his Father in the Womb of his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he made it appear by the thoughts of his heart, that he reſpects his body as a Holocauſt, and he teſtifieth by the language of his Prophets, reported by his Apoſtles, that he was cloathed with our fleſh only to make an oblation of it. <hi>Sacrifice wouldeſt thou not, but a body haſt thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared me.</hi> His deſign is to ſupply the unprofitableneſſe of the Law, to offer to his Father a Victime well-pleaſing to him, and meritorious for us, that finding our ſalvation in his loſſe, we might be reconciled to God by his Death;

Therefore doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often invite us to diſcharge this duty; he ſpeaks to us of nothing but Oblations and Altars; he exhorts us to offer our ſelves to God in a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, and he would have us looking upon our ſelves as reaſonable and living ſacrifices; our whole life ſhould be but one continued Oblation. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> treading in the ſteps of his Maſter, teacheth us the ſame Truth, and far differing from their judgement, who would mingle Roſes with Thorns in Chriſtianity, tels us, that the life of the Faithfull, if it be ordered according to the Maximes of the Goſpel, is but a languiſhing and a painfull Martyrdome.</p>
                  <p>This Circumſtance diſcovers another; and the Sacrifice of theſe two Bodies, leads me inſenſibly to their perſecution: For the Natural Body of the Son of God was not exempted from ſorrow, becauſe innocent; his Trials began with his Life; he had Enemies aſſoon as he had Subjects; and if he ſaw Kings at his Cradle paying their Homages,

Indeed the Church never wanted perſecutors, ſhe hath ſeen all the Princes of the Earth armed againſt her Children; Three full Ages have exerciſed her patience; ſhe hath watered the whole Earth with her blood; neither is there any corner in the world, wherein ſhe hath not given teſtimony of her courage. The converſion of Heathen Princes hath not been the end of her perſecutions; Sinners have ſucceeded Tyrants; the good have found tormentors in the perſon of the wicked; Every beleever hath found by experience, that the Maxime of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is true, and that it is impoſſible to live piouſly, and not to be perſecuted: <hi>All thoſe that will live godlily in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed their perſecution hath appeared glorious, and 'tis in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that they have another reſemblance to the Naturall Body of the Son of God: For his Father glorified him upon the Croſſe; hee would have his Innocence known at his Death, that his Executioners ſhould be the firſt witneſſes of it; that to the confuſion of the Jews the Judge that condemned him ſhould make his Apology; that the Theeves that ſuffered with him ſhould publiſh his Royalty; and the Soldiers that nailed him to the Croſſe, become his Adorers. But as if ſo many miracles had not ſufficiently magnified his onely Son, he would have whole Nature weare mourning for him; The Sun muſt bewail his Death, and the Earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with amazement; the rocks cleave aſunder with pangs of ſorrow, and all creatures celebrate the obſequies of a dying God. Indeed there never was a more dolefull and more auguſt ſolemnity then what appeared at the Death of Jeſus Chriſt. Men lament the death of their Soveraigns; they expreſſe ſome ſadneſſe, though for the moſt part 'tis either counterfeit, or intereſſed; Thoſe that expected their liberality, are afflicted at their death; thoſe that feared their power or their diſpleaſure, rejoyce: But were they ſo generally beloved, that the regret was univerſall, at leaſt we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that Nature would not weep over their Funerals, ſhe would be inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their death, nor would ſhe diſorder her Courſe to witneſſe her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. This honour was reſerved for Jeſus Chriſt; There was never any King but he, regiſtred by quick and dead. None but this Innocent drew tears from the Stars; and the Son of God is the only Soveraign, whoſe obſequies all creatures ſolemnly attended. 'Tis true his Myſticall Body partakes of this honour with him: Nature hath many times wrought miracles to publiſh the Innocence of Martyrs; the fire hath loſt his heat, that it might not be inſtrumentall to their puniſhment; wilde Beaſts have

But the Scripture whoſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word is an Oracle, teacheth us, that the death of the Myſticall Body of Chriſt ſhall receive the ſame honours at the end of the world, that his Naturall Body received in Mount <hi>Calvary:</hi> For when the number of the Elect ſhall be perfect, when Jeſus Chriſt coming to judge the quick and the dead, ſhall cut off the corrupted members from his Myſticall Body, and remove thoſe from his perſon that were united to it only by a vain Character, and an unprofitable Faith, the ſame prodigies that appeared at his death, ſhall appear at this Judgement; and according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Fathers, Nature that bewailed Jeſus Chriſt in his Naturall Body, ſhall bewail him again in his Myſticall Body: and all creatures ſhall put on mourning for the death of their Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>Finally, theſe two Bodies ſhall have the ſame deſtiny after their Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as they had the ſame during their Life; for the one ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified as the other, and they ſhall both receive the recompence due to their labours: The Son of God roſe gloriouſly out of his Tomb after he had given aſſurance to his Apoſtles; he was taken up into Heaven, to reign there eternally with his Father; The Angels made a part of his Triumph; the Captives he delivered from the <hi>Lymbo</hi>'s waited upon him; thoſe gates of Braſſe and Steel that had been ſhut ſince the ſin of Man, opened at his word; and his Body that was pierc'd with the nails, rent with ſtripes, torn with thorns, was ſet at the right hand of his Father upon a Throne, whoſe ornament was Juſtice, and the foundation Mercy: His Myſticall Body ſhall always receive the ſame glorious entertainment; the Faithfull are admitted into the company of the Bleſſed; the Saints ſhall reign in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the Angels; they ſhall be mingled in their Hierarchies according to their merits; and as heretofore of the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> was made one Church Militant, of Men and Angels is daily made one Church Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant; The bodies of the Faithfull ſhall accompany their ſouls in glory in the generall Reſurrection; thoſe members that have ſuffered in the quarrell of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be freed from all miſeries; the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſhall rouze them out of their dormitories by the clattering ſound of a miraculous trumpet; it will find in ſpite of the flames, thoſe that have been burnt to aſhes; in ſpite of the waters thoſe that have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the deep; and working as many miracles as there ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of death to overcome, ſhall treat the Faithfull as it hath already treated Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that we may ſay of both the Bodies of the Son of God, thoſe glorious words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Great is the Myſterie of Godlineſſe:</hi> Indeed 'tis a Sacrament of Piety, that the Word was pleaſed

Thus Jeſus Chriſt and his Church are truly allied by fleſh, and may upon a better title then other conjugall parties ſay in the difference of their conditions they are but one Body.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo but one voice, becauſe they always ſpeak together; the Church is the Organ of her Beloved, and Ieſus Chriſt is the interpreter of his Church; He expreſſed himſelf by her mouth before he was born upon Earth; he ſpeaks yet by her now that he is aſcended up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and as their intereſts are inſeparable, their prayers are common, and their language is equally entertained by the Father. Thence it comes to paſſe that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> unfolding this profound myſtery, teacheth us, that the Son of God carries himſelf diverſly towards the Faithfull, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different qualities that ſeparate, or unite him to them. He intercedes for them as their Chief Prieſt, whoſe principall Office is to offer up mens prayers, and to draw down bleſſings from Heaven upon their heads: He hears their ſupplications with his Father, to whom he is equall in Majeſty; he is willingly overcome by the tears of the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and having prayed for them as their Prieſt, he hears them as their God: Finally, he prays in them as their Head, he delivers the Word in the name of his Body; he defends the intereſts of his members; he pleads his own cauſe in pleading theirs, and asks a Grace for himſelf, in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mercy for them. Thence it comes to paſſe that the Father giving way to the Prayers of his Son, ſo eaſily lends an ear to the Petitions of the Church, becauſe hee ownes the voice of Jeſus Chriſt in that of his Spouſe, and grants that to the merits of the one, which he might juſtly refuſe to the demerits of the other.

Thence it comes to paſt, that on the Croſs, where he ſtands the Caution of Sinners, he complains that his Father forſakes, though he be inſeparable from him; and beholding himſelf as the Victim of Sin, uſeth language unworthy of his Innocence, but worthy of his Love,

This is it that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acquaints us with in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that comprebends as many Myſteries as Words. If we conſider Jeſus Chriſt as equal to his Father, he hears our prayers with him: if we conſider him in the form of a ſervant, as like to ſinenrs, he preſents his prayers with them: there he is the Creator, here he is created; but remaining unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is united to his Creature, to change him; and makes himſelf one man with him, whereof they are joyntly the Head and Body. Thus ſometimes we pray to him, and ſometimes alſo we pray in him, and he prays with us; he ſpeaks by our mouth, we by his; and living in one and the ſame Body, we many times uſe the ſame language. 'Tis in the view of this Myſtery that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath diſcovered a Secret to explain all thoſe paſſages that ſeem to concern the Innocence of Jeſus Chriſt: For, as by conſequence of the Marriage contracted with the Church, he is included in her obligations, he ſpeaks many times in the perſon of the Church: and, that we miſtake not, we muſt have this alliance always before our eyes, and not be aſtoniſhed that the Son of God, who hath vouchſafed to bear our miſeries, hath been pleaſed to ſpeak our language. The Church, ſaith that great Doctor, is made up of all the Faithful,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quia ergo totus Chriſtus caput eſt &amp; corpus Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae, prepter a in omnibus Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis ſic audiamus voces capitis, ut audiamus voces corporis.</hi> Aug. in Pſal. 56.</note> becauſe all the Faithful are the Members of Jeſus Chriſt: Though her Head be in heaven, he fails not to guide her upon earth; and though ſeparated by the diſtance of places, ceaſeth not to be united to her by charity. Wherefore Chriſt making the Head and the Body, we ought not in the Pſalms to ſeparate the voice of the Head from that of the Body, nor think it ſtrange that he that never deſerted the Church, never held other language then his Spouſe did. This it it that he treats of elſewhere, in clearer and fuller terms: If Jeſus be our Head,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115672:73"/>and we his Body, the Head and the Body compoſe whole Jeſus Chriſt; nor is Jeſus Chriſt entire, if he comprehend not both. This Maxime muſt ſerve us as a light to explain the Scripture by; with which if we are not always enlightned, we are in danger to miſtake: For ſometimes we meet with words that cannot be applied to the Head, and which would involve us in an errour, or in doubt, did we apply them to the body; there are others that cannot be appropriated to the Body, and yet are uttered by Jeſus Chriſt: To unravel theſe difficulties, we need but attribute to the Head what cannot agree to the Body; remembring that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks ſometimes in his own perſon, and ſometimes in the perſon of the Church: He ſpake certainly in her name, when he complained that his Father had forſaken him; becauſe we know very well, the Son was never abandoned by the Father, were it not when he ſuſtained the perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was forſaken of God as ſoon as he became guilty.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this Truth is but too evident, let us paſs to the Third con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Marriage of Jeſus Chriſt with his Church, and ſee how they are two in one and the ſame paſſion. One of the chiefeſt effects of Love, is,
<note place="margin">Anima eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis ubi amat quàm ubi ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat.</note> to make us Live where we Love, and to make us Suffer where we Live: Experience better perſwades us of this Maxime then Reaſon; and 'tis needleſs to prove a Truth which every man may evidence in himſelf. A fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows he is more affected with the ſorrows of his children then with his own: a husband is not ignorant that he ſufters leſs in his own perſon then in that of his wife: and all Lovers proclaim, that the injuries or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of their Miſtreſſes wound them deeper then thoſe that fall upon themſelves.

As Charity, which unites Jeſus Chriſt to the Church, is ſtronger then Conjugal love, ſo doth it more advantageouſly produce this effect in them; Their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are common; the Son of God ſuffers no ſorrows which the Church reſents not, and the Church endures no torments which the Son of God complains not of: Therefore hath S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaid, that the Church ſuffered in Jeſus Chriſt, when jeſus Chriſt ſuffered for the ſalvation of the Church; and that Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered in the Church, when the Church was perſecuted for the glory of Jeſus Chriſt: their complaints were proofs of their ſufferings: and as the Church complained in Jeſus Chriſt, when he cried out upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Jeſus complained in behalf of his Church, when from the midſt of his glory he ſaid, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> But as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had learnt this truth from the mouth of the Son of God himſelf, by whom he was informed that a man could not perſecute the Church, but he muſt perſecute Jeſus Chriſt; there was not any of the Apoſtles who ſo highly exalted his labours as he did: For knowing very well that he was a Member of the Church, in which condition he could not ſuffer, but Jeſus
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115672:73"/>Chriſt muſt ſuffer with him, he ſpeaks of his own ſufferings, as of thoſe of his Maſter; and out of a confidence which could ariſe from nothing but his love, he boaſts, that in ſuffering he finiſhed the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Adimpleo ea quae deſunt paſſionum Chriſti.</hi> He knew very well, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting to the ſorrows of the Son of God, that the rage of the executioners was glutted upon his perſon, that the Truth of Figures was accompliſhed in his death, and that himſelf, before he bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt, had ſaid aloud, <hi>Conſummatum eſt:</hi> But he knew alſo that Jeſus Chriſt had two Bodies; that he ſuffered in one, what he could not ſuffer in the other; and that honouring his Father in both, he ſacrificed himſelf in his Members, after he had ſacrificed himſelf in his Perſon. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> happily expreſſeth the meaning of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in theſe words: Jeſus Chriſt ſuffers no more in that fleſh he carried into heaven; but he ſuffers in mine that is ſtill perſecuted upon the earth: nor are we to wonder at it, becauſe it is no more I that live, but he that liveth in me. And if this Maxime were not true, Jeſus Chriſt had never complained of the perſecution of <hi>Saul,</hi> nor ever <hi>Saul</hi> have been ſo bold as to ſay he had filled up what was wanting in the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But a little to clear this paſſage, we muſt ſay, that the Son of God being the Pledge and Surety of ſinners, was willing to ſatisfie the juſtice of his Father, and bear all the pains their ſins deſerved:

But becauſe the Body his mother gave him could not ſuffer all theſe deaths, their different kinds being incompatible, and that one and the ſame man could not be nailed to the Croſs, devoured by wilde beaſts, choaked in the waters, conſumed by the flames, he was pleaſed to aſſociate a myſtical Body, which being compounded of different Members, might undergo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers puniſhments; and, to ſatisfie the exceſs of his Charity, might honour his Father by as many ſacrifices as there were kindes of death in Nature.

                  <p>But, not to urge this conceit any further, 'tis enough that we learn from it, that Jeſus and the Church are united in their ſufferings upon earth, and by a neceſſary conſequence aſſures us they ſhall be ſo one day in their reſt in heaven. For though the Church ſigh here belowe, ſhe knows her Beloved will keep his word, that having had a part in his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, ſhe ſhall have a ſhare in his triumphs; and having been two in one Fleſh, they ſhall be two in one and the ſame Felicity. She hath the promiſes
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115672:74"/>of Jeſus Chriſt for caution of her hope; and when ſhe remembers the prayer her Beloved made to his Father in her behalf, ſhe expects the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, with conſtancy of aſſurance: <hi>Father, I will that where I am, there alſo my ſervants be.</hi> Whenever Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks to his Father, 'tis with ſo much reſpect, that he ſeems rather a Servant then a Son; when he asks that his Church may reign with him in his glory, 'tis with ſo much freedom of ſpeech, that he ſeems equal to his Father, and that his demand is rather a determination then a prayer; <hi>Volo Pater:</hi> ſo that the Church, who hath paſſed thorow all the degrees of unity with her Beloved, expects this laſt with confidence, and makes no more doubt of the Eternity of her reſt, then of the Verity of the words of her Beloved.

But the Divine Providence, ſaith S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> hath delivered us from this perplexity: for he that drew us out of Nothing, hath drawn us out of Sin; and he that Created us, is the ſame that Redeemed us: ſo that without any fear of Jealouſie, we may compare theſe two benefits, and give one the pre-eminence, without injuring him of whom we have received them. Me thinks I may ſay the ſame concerning the ſubject I am in hand
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:115672:74"/>with; and free from any apprehenſion, confront the quality of Brethren with that of Members, becauſe we hold them both of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the ſame who was pleaſed to be our Brother, diſdained not to be our Head. Nature hath found out no alliance neerer then that of Brothers and Members; and, though ſhe be ſo ingenious, ſhe hath not been able to link men in a ſtronger bond of relation, then in giving them one and the ſame Father, or one and the ſame Head. Brothers are Slips of the ſame Stock: if they aſcend one degree, they will finde, that before their conception, they made one portion of their Father; and that before their birth, they were a part of the bowels of their mother. Friendſhip, which is ſo much eſteemed of in the world, is but a Copie of this Alliance: Friends are Brethren that our Will beſtows upon us; and Brethren are Friends that Nature ſtores us with: but as that which is voluntary never equals that which is natural, 'tis very hard for Friends to love ſo tenderly as Brothers do. Nevertheleſs, if the affinity of theſe begin by Unity, it inſenſibly tends to Diviſion: Brothers children are but Couſins; their Grandchildren are yet at a farther diſtance; and it falls out in time, that thoſe that iſſued from one father, become, by continuance of Generations, ſtrangers and enemies.</p>
                  <p>I know very well that Chriſtians have priviledges that raiſe them above the condition of Men; and that Grace, more powerful then Nature, hath given them a Father and Mother from whom they are never divided: For the Son of God unites us to his Perſon in begetting us; of children he makes us members; and as if the Alliance of Father were not ſtrict enough, he becomes our Head; that ſubſiſting in him, our life may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from his. The Church imitates the charity of her Beloved; ſhe is ſo tenderly affected towards her children, that ſhe brings them up in the ſame boſome where ſhe conceived them: There are none but He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks that go out from her; and they, as Vipers, muſt tear her bowels, and offer violence to her Love, in making a breach in her Unity. Though other Mothers bear their children Nine months, with an affection that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceth their travel, yet do they long to be eased of that painful load, and the Infant deſires to quit that troubleſome priſon: Both of them do their utmoſt for a ſeparation; and if the children ſeek their liberty, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are as earneſt after their delivery. But the Church is ſo good a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe is never rid of her burden; they always make a part of her inwards, as they always are a part of the body of their Father; they are born in the ſame place they are formed; and as their Regeneration divides them not from Jeſus Chriſt, their Generation divorces them not from the Church.</p>
                  <p>But who ſees not, that, to entertain this Union, the quality of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers comes in to the aſſiſtance of that of Children; and that the Faithful are much more knit together for being Members of the ſame Head, then for being Children of the ſame Father? We make up one Body with him: Time, that divides Brothers, cannot divide Chriſtians; and as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>This is the ſecond difference I obſerve between brethren and members: for though brothers have tumbled in the ſame belly, iſſued from the ſame Father, have been nurſed with the ſame milk, and brought up in the ſame family; yet many times their minds are as different as their bodies; and nature that takes pleaſure in the variety of her works, or ſin that travels to divide them, puts ſo little correſpondence in their wils, that thoſe that have lived in the ſame womb, cannot live in the ſame houſe.

For the diviſion of goods occaſions that of hearts; the parting of portions ſets men at enmity; and as they know their inheritances cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but they muſt be diminiſhed, they are unwilling to have brothers, leſt they ſhould be troubled with co-heirs; This was the reaſon <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſometimes made uſe of, to let the Heathens ſee the Chriſtians much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerved the name of brothers, then thoſe that came from the ſame Father, becauſe the ſharing of goods divided the affections of theſe, and covetouſneſſe which admits of no companions, made them contrive the death of their brothers after they had longd for that of their Fathers. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Son of God hath remedied this diſorder in his Church, becauſe the Inheritance of Chriſtians being infinite cannot be divided; They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy one and the ſame good in common; they ſpoil not others of what they poſſeſſe themſelves, and as light communicates it ſelf intirely to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon, felicity is wholly imparted to every Beleever. Nevertheleſſe, we muſt acknowledge that the quality of members addes ſomething in this point to that of brethren: for whatever good intelligence there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe, it never equals what is between thoſe. Brothers alwayes ſtudy their own advantage: as they are ſeparated by birth, ſo are they parted by intereſts; neither can charity well regulate their deſires, that the one doe not many times enrich themſelves with the loſſe of the other:

                  <p>But to make this conception a little clearer, we muſt repeat what we ſaid in the beginning of this Diſcourſe, and take notice that the alliance we have with Jeſus Chriſt, is much different from that we have from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam:</hi> That of <hi>Adam</hi> commenceth in unity, and terminates in diviſion; we are all deſcended from one Father; we were but one &amp; the ſame thing in his Perſon, but the ſucceſſion of time hath ſo divided us, that of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren we are become ſtrangers and unknown: For the family of <hi>Adam</hi> multiplying by the birth of his children, made Towns which by their number grew into Provinces, Provinces formd Kingdomes, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes at laſt peopled the Univerſe; Thus men who were brothers at their birth, were eſtranged by diſtance of place, divided by languages, parted by intereſts, and oppoſite to each other by the contrariety of their humours.</p>
                  <p>The Son of God finding us in this deplorable condition, makes us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115672:76"/>to unity by all the degrees that tumbled us from it; His love aſſiſted with his power hath placed us in the ſame Kingdome, given us the ſame Soveraign, under whoſe Laws we breath an acceptable liberty, <hi>Feciſti nos Deo noſtroregnu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> But becauſe all the Subjects of a Kingdom know not one another, the diſtance of places eſtrangeth their hearts; he hath brought us into one City, that being ſhut up within her Lines of Communication, we may the eaſier converſe together, and of fellow Subjects may become fellow Citizens: <hi>Vos eſtis Cives Sanctorum.</hi> But foraſmuch as this alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is not the ſtricteſt, there are factions many times in Cities which ſow diſcord in mens minds: all the inhabitants ſteer not one way, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of quarters hinders their familiarity; he hath adopted us into one family, that being the Domeſticks of one Maſter, our amity may be the cloſer by how much our condition is more equall: <hi>Vos eſtis Domeſtici Dei.</hi> Had he left us in this ſtate, he had taken pains enough for our good; but as Domeſticks have different deſignes, jealouſie ſteals into their ſouls, and the hope of profit which is the end of baſe and mercenary ſouls, ſuffers them not to taſte the ſweets of true Friendſhip; he hath raiſed them to the quality of children, and giving them their Soveraign for their Father, will have them love one another as brethren; <hi>Vos omnes fratres eſtis.</hi> Morality and Politicks have nothing to wiſh for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this favour, ſeeing all the Subjects of a State linkd together by the bonds of ſo indiſſoluble an alliance beleeve nothing can be added to their happineſſe. But God who is pleaſed to outgoe our hopes, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to the perfection of unity in making us members of the ſame body, and giving us our Father for our Head; So that all the Faithfull make up but one Man; all their conditions are happily confounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all of them making up one part of Jeſus Chriſt, they are quickned with his Spirit, clarified with his Light, warmd with his Love, till they be taken up into his Immenſities, and conſummated in his Glory.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IF it be a Truth, that whatever is glorious as relating to Jeſus Chriſt, is profitable to Chriſtians: it is not true on the other ſide, that whatever is beneficiall to Chriſtians, is honourable to Jeſus Chriſt; For the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Head whence all their advantages are derived, is the ſource of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115672:76"/>all thoſe evils Jeſus Chriſt underwent; and had he not been the Head of ſinners, he had not been obliged to be their Surety. Hee hath as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, made a compact with men extreamly advantageous for them, but very prejudiciall to himſelf. For as the union which Nature or Grace puts between the members of the ſame body makes their good and bad common, we find that the Son of God imparts his priviledges to us, and aſſumes our miſeries to himſelf. He enters into our lowneſſe, and we are admitted into his Greatneſſe; he is burdend with our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and we are inveſted with his merits; he is made the Sonne of Man, and makes us the Children of God. This important Verity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a full Diſcourſe, and 'tis juſt that in acknowledgement of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations we have to Jeſus Chriſt, we take notice of what he drew from us, and of what we have received from him.</p>
                  <p>Innocence is one of the Apennages of the Word Incarnate;
<note place="margin">

Dom. ſer. 10.</note> were he not God by his Perſon, he would be innocent by his Conception, and having the Holy Ghoſt for his Principle, and the Virgin for his Mother, 'tis impoſſible he ſhould have contracted the ſin of <hi>Adam:</hi> Wherefore when the Angel expounded to the Virgin the Grandeurs of her onely Son, he expreſly obſerves that his Sanctity was derived from his Birth, and being the work of the Holy Ghoſt, muſt therefore be exempt from all impurity: <hi>Spiritus Sanctus ſuperveniet in te, ideoque quod naſcetur ex te Sanctum vocabitur filius Dei.</hi> In the mean time the quality of Head obliges him to ſtoop under the load of our offences: Hee that is innocent by nature, becomes guilty by love; and when he united him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his members, he became their Surety, and engaged himſelfe to ſatisfie for them. Thence it is that the Prophets ſpeak not of him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a man of ſorrows, but as a man who ſtands Hoſtage for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> and who is voluntarily boundto bear all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments their ſins are obnoxious to. This made the Father ſay by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Eſay, Percuſſi eum propter ſcelera populi mei;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ipſe vulneratus eſt propter ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitates noſtras, attritus eſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcelera noſtra; poſuit Dominus in eo iniquitate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noſtrum.</hi> Iſa. 53.</note> This made Saint <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>That he was the Lamb of God that taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſins of the world;</hi> and this made Jeſus Chriſt himſelf upon the Croſſe ſay, that his ſins condemned him to death, <hi>Longe à ſalute mea verba delictorum meorum;</hi> For he died not that ignominious death, but becauſe he ſtood in the place of men, and being their pledge, becauſe he is their Head, he was bound to ſatisfie for them the Juſtice of his Father.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the ſentence that obliges the Son of God to death, is the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt and unjuſteſt ſentence in the world: 'Tis unjuſt if we conſider it as proceeding from the mouth of <hi>Pilate,</hi> becauſe all the crimes Jeſus Chriſt was accuſed of, were forged by his enemies; 'Tis juſt, if we conſider it as proceeding from the mouth of the Eternall Father, becauſe his Son ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before him as the Head of all men; and he beholds him as an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Victime, whoſe charity hath made him a Delinquent. Indeed our ſins are not remitted, but becauſe the Son of God is charged with them;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115672:77"/>the fury of God the Father is not appeaſed, but becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath ſatisfied it; nor doe we live ſecurely in the world, but becauſe our Head hath reſtored us our Innocence. This is the compact he made with us; he hath taken our evils to confer upon us his merits: he hath made a change of qualities; and to procure us that of the children of God, hath volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily accepted of that of Surety for ſinners. This is it that Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> confirms to us in explaining thoſe words of the Prophet, which he ſuppoſes ſpoken by Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Domine Deus meus clamavi ad te, &amp; ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti me.</hi> The Son of God ſaith he prayd to his Father in the mount of Olives before his death, and his Father heald him after his death; but how could he heal him that never was wounded? did he heal his Word who was God equall with himſelf? No certainly, but he heald us in his Perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Word being made our Head, was loaden with our wounds, and had changed them into remedies to cure us of our ſcars: He heald him then when he raiſed him from the dead, and the Cure was perfect when coming forth from the boſome of death, he entred into that of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and paſsd into that happy ſtate where death loſing the victory, had now no more dominion over him.</p>
                  <p>As Jeſus Chriſt hath communicated to us his innocence, taking upon himſelf our ſins, ſo hath he made us partakers of his ſtrength by taking part of our infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For though the Word was as well the Power as the Wiſdome of his Father, and by condition of his Eternall Generation he was as well his <hi>Arme</hi> as his <hi>Idea;</hi>

In all his actions he mixt weakneſs with power; he never wrought a miracle wherein he gave not ſome proof that he was a man, and in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece of his miracles, the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, he ſhed tears to teſtifie this truth; He trembled in the Garden; he gave fear and ſadneſs leave to ſeize upon his heart, and appear in his countenance; he gave witneſs that death and ſin had made an impreſſion of ſorrow upon his ſoul; and he that was happier and ſtronger then the Angels, appeard as weak and wretched as men. This wonderfull proceeding was neither without deſign nor juſtice; For ſeeing the Son of God was our Head, he muſt of neceſſity be charged with our infirmities: ſeeing that quality obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him to make a change with us, he muſt needs aſſume our weakneſs and indue us with his courage. Thence it came to paſs that the Martyrs bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their tortures with ſuch magnanimity; that Virgins contemnd death, and ran to execution as to a recreation; that Chriſtian Philoſophers more conſtant and more humble then Stoicks, without any other ſuccour then that of Grace laughd at Grief, and preſervd the tranquillity of mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the ſharpeſt gripes of an ingenious torment. This is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo happily expreſſeth in his eloquent diſcourſes: As Jeſus Chriſt took fleſh without ſin, ſo was he made partaker of our infirmities without
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:115672:77"/>partaking our unrighteouſneſs; that aſſuming the one, and delivering us from the other, it might appear he was therefore made our Head, that he might be our Redeemer. Proſecuting the ſame meditation, he addes, that we are more beholding to the Weakneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, then to his Power:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fortitudo Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti te creavit, infirmitas Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti te recreavit: fortit do Chri, ti feeit ut quod non erat eſſet, infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitas Chriſti fecit ut quod erat non peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret: con idit nos fortitudine ſua, quaeſivit nos in. firmitate ſua.</hi> Aug. Tract. 15 in Joan.</note> For his Power Created us, his Infirmity Redeemed us; his Omnipotency Formed us, his Weakneſs Reformed us; his Power made that which was Not begin to be, and his Weakneſs hath kept that which Was from periſhing; that being obliged for life and ſalvation to one and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt, we may publikely confeſs what we owe his Power, and what we owe his weakneſs. Foraſmuch as this Grace is rare and precious, it had its Types and Figures in the infancy of the world; and <hi>Adam,</hi> who was <hi>the form</hi> or mould <hi>of him that was to come,</hi> according to the language of the Apoſtle, diſcovered this myſtery to us in his perſon: for, beſides that his wife came forth of his ſide whilſt he lay aſleep, as the Church did out of Chriſt's during his death, ſhe was made of his Bone, and not of his Fleſh, and that vacuity was filled up with Fleſh, and not with Bone: What was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to be hinted to us in this Ceremony, where the woman taken from the bone appeared the ſtronger, and the man formed of the fleſh appeared the weaker, but that Jeſus Chriſt took his infirmity from the Church, and the Church took her ſtrength from Jeſus Chriſt? Indeed, his Weakneſs is our Power, becauſe we acknowledge our ſelves ſtrong, in that we are his Members; and that ſeparated from him, we are ſo impotent, that there is no enemy but may overcome us, nor any tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but may prevail againſt us.</p>
                  <p>This Myſtery would be unconceiveable, if a greater did not give it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in our mindes: For we know the Son of God would be tempted, to deliver us from temptation; and not content to vanquiſh, thereby to gain us the victory, he was pleaſed, out of an exceſs of love, to ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the loweſt proof an Innocent could receive. Though all Pains are the tokens of Sin, and the creature is not Miſerable, but ſince he became Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, Religion teacheth us there are Afflictions that may conſiſt with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence; a man may be Wretched, and not Guilty; and ſuffer for the glory of his God, and the ſafety of his Brethren, without prejudicing his honour. Death was not ignominious to Jeſus Chriſt, though 'twas the firſt puniſhment of ſin; the motive made it honourable: and undergoing it to ſatisfie his Fathers juſtice, it was not ſo much a Puniſhment as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: But Temptation is always infamous: though it be a ſtep to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, yet is it a way that leads to Sin: and we may ſay, If he that is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted be not Guilty, neither is he perfectly Innocent; becauſe he that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth the Temptation, is perſwaded that he can make him a Criminal: So that of all the afflictions the Son of God laboured under, there is none more ſhameful, in my opinion, then Temptation; becauſe the devil that ſet upon him, promiſed himſelf ſucceſs in perverting him; and looking upon him as a Man, hop'd to make him a Sinner. Upon the Croſs he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:115672:78"/>onely his Life, in the Wilderneſs he attempted his Innocence: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs he pretended onely to render him Miſerable, but in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fart he tri'd to make him a Delinquent: ſo that we may ſay, he was more humbled in the Solitude of the Deſart, then in the Agony of the Croſs; and that Temptation carried more infamy and torment with it then Death did. Now he endured not this affront, but becauſe he was our Head; he ſtoopt not to this puniſhment, but to deliver his Members; nor did he give the devils leave to ſet upon him, but to facilitate their defeat, and open the way to our victory. This is it that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> gloſſeth admirably well upon the Sixtieth Pſalm.

Or, to ſay the ſame thing in other words; If we were tempted in him, 'tis in him alſo that we overcame the devil our enemy: He certainly could have difcarded him from his perſon, and, uſing him like a rebellious ſlave, have puniſhed his raſh boldneſs, by commanding him to hell: but, had he not been willing to be tempted, he had not taught us to overcome by his example, nor had the combat he fought in the wilderneſs procured us the honour of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.

                  <p>Finally, to conclude this Diſcourſe, The Son of God was willing to bear the reproaches of the Croſs, and to merit for us the priviledges of Glory: For, being charged with our iniquities, he ſuffered death, the puniſhment of them, permitted Shame to be added to Cruelty; that ſpoiling him of Life,

In the mean time, his Puniſhment purchaſed our Glory, his Death merited our Immortality; and in ſtead of taking vengeance of our crimes, he procures us his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages. It ſeems, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Father miſtook himſelf; he treats his onely Son as a Delinquent, and handles Men as Innocents; he crowns him with Thorns, theſe with Glory; and, confounding the Sinner with the Juſt, confounds Chaſtiſements with Rewards. But if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Son of God took our place, and we his; that he is our Head, and we his Members, we ſhall finde that his Father had reaſon to puniſh him, and to reward us, becauſe, having made a change with us, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Guilty, we Innocent.

                  <p>Their Intereſt requires that they be inſeparably faſtned to that from whence they receive their life, leſt their diviſion, with their death, deprive them of all thoſe advantages which ſpring from the union they have with their Head.

But though the hands are ſo induſtriouſly ſubtil, and the legs ſo vigorouſly ſtrong, they are abſolutely uſeleſs, becauſe their ſeparation deprives them of the influences of their head. This Maxime, ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in Nature, is much more evident in Grace: For the Son of God hath no need of his Members; 'tis Mercy, and not Neceſſity, obligeth him to make uſe of them: He is not at all more powerful when united to them, nor more feeble when ſeparated from them: Faith tells us he can do all

Therefore the firſt obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians, is to unite themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt; to ſeek their life in this union, and to believe that their death is the infallible conſequence of their diviſion.</p>
                  <p>This is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> repreſents us in this Diſcourſe, which though long, cannot be tedious, becauſe there is nothing in it that is not delightfull and neceſſary. As the Body hath many members, which though different in number, make up but one body: ſo Jeſus Chriſt hath many members, which in the diverſity of their conditions, conſtitute alſo but one body; ſo that we are always with him as with our Head, and drawing from him our ſtrength as well as our life, we can neither act nor live without him: We with him make up a fruitful Vine, that bears more Grapes then Leaves; but divided from him, we are like thoſe Branches which being good for nothing, are deſtin'd to the ſlames, when ſtript off from the Vine. Therefore doth the Son of God ſo earneſtly affirm it in the Goſpel, that without him we can doe nothing, that our intereſts as well as our love,

Theſe words happily expreſs all the obligations of the Faithfull, and make them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern, that liberty can doe nothing without grace; and that the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers divided from their Head, with all their naturall endowments and advantages, are good for nothing but to be eternally burnt in Hel.</p>
                  <p>From this firſt obligation is derived a ſecond no whit leſſe conſiderable: For ſeeing the members draw life from their Head, and their diviſion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their ruine, they are bound abſolutely to depend upon him, nor to have any other deſignes then his: As they live by a borrowed life, they ought to act by a forain vertue, and to abandon themſelves ſo fully to him that inanimates them, as to have no other conduct but his. Thence it comes to paſs that ſelf-deniall is the firſt vertue recommended to a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that renouncing himſelf he may obey Jeſus Chriſt, and conceiving himſelf in a ſtrange body, may act by his motions who is the Head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Philoſophy hath laid down this poſition, that man ought to purchaſe his liberty with the expence of his riches; that 'tis better be poor, then be a ſlave; and that 'twas a gainfull bargain, where parting with the goods of fortune, we purchaſed the quietneſs of mind: ſhe hath alſo judged ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that the body is to be tam'd when it grows rebellious againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that nouriſhment is to be retrencht as provender from an unruly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:115672:79"/>wanton horſe; and his ſtomack taken down by the aſcetick diſcipline of Faſts and Watchings: But it never enterd into her Theorems, that to be happy, a man muſt renounce his underſtanding, unlord his reaſon to become learned, condemn his judgement to become wiſe. Indeed Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy knew not that we are the members of a Body whereof the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Word is the Head; and that this condition that raiſeth us as high as the light of Faith, forbids us the pure uſe of Reaſon, commanding us to ſoar above our own thoughts to ſearch into his mind who will be the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Life; For there is no body but ſees that this obligation is as juſt as honourable; that ſince Chriſtians are rather Gods then men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the union they have contracted with the Word Incarnate, they ought to act rather by his motion then their own reaſon; and remember that ſeeing he is the Head that quickens them, he ought to be the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that guides them. The whole drift of the Goſpel labours to perſwade us this Truth; all its commands and counſels inſinuate this obligation into us; and when the Son of God gives order to us to renounce our own will, to combate our inclinations, to love our enemies, and to hate our friends, 'tis only to teach us that being no longer at our own diſpoſall we ought to have no other mind but what he inſpires into us by his Grace.</p>
                  <p>A Third Obligation ſlows from this which is to be conformable to our Head: to imitate his actions, having followed his motions, and to be made ſo like him, that he may not be aſhamed to own us for his members. Nature exacts not this condition from the parts that compoſe mans body; ſhe will not have them reſemble their Head, becauſe there would be inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and impoſſibility in the very deſire; 'Tis enough that they receive his influences, that they obey his motions, and that their whole imitation conſiſt in their meer ſubjection. But Morality and the Politicks will have the members that make up a Myſticall Body, adde imitation to their other duties, that they be regulated by their Head as by their model; that they ſtudy his inclinations, and be the perfect copies of this firſt Originall. Thus we ſee that Kings are the inanimate examples of their ſubjects, the living Laws of their States, and the prime Maſters of their people: Every one makes it his glory to imitate them, they are perſwaded that whatever they doe is lawfull, and that thoſe that are the Images of God, may very well be the Examplars of men. Though this Maxime be true, yet it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; For as Greatneſs does not always inſpire Goodneſs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quid eſt aliud vitia incendere, quam authores illos Deos vel reges inſcribere, &amp; dare morbo exemplo Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis aut Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtatis excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam lieentiam?</hi> Senec.</note> nor are Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns the moſt perfect; and thoſe that may doe what they will, doe not always what they ſhould, it fals out many times that the greateſt are the moſt vicious; and the readieſt way to corrupt a whole State is to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it the Examples of the Governours. Therefore hath Philoſophy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>Ideas</hi> of Wiſdome, and deſpairing to finde among men models which may be ſecurely tranſcribed, hath made a Romance of Princes, by the ſame artifice diſcovering their irregularity &amp; her own impotency. But the Eternall Father giving us Jeſus Chriſt for our Head, hath withall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115672:80"/>him for our Example; he will have our life fully conformable to his; that his actions be our documents; that we be admitted into his School when we are united to his Body; that we ſeek for perfection where we found life, and that we be as well his Images as his Members. This is it that Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> acquaints us with: Our Head ſhall not reign in glory without his Members, provided they be one with him by Faith, and conformable to him in their Manners: Both theſe conditions are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Union without Conformity is but meer hypocriſie, and Conformity without Union is pure vanity: He that is united to Chriſt and imitates him not, cannot eſcape a fearfull ſeparation one day, by an Eternall <hi>Anathema;</hi> and he that imitates him without believing, will perceive in time that his imitation was but counterfeit, and that he was ſo much more oppoſite to Jeſus Chriſt, the more he appeard only conformable to him. We muſt therefore joyn theſe two duties together, if we will have them uſefull; and having been united to our Head by Faith, conform to him by good works, that we be not reproached to have deſpiſed him whom we cannot find in our hearts to imitate.</p>
                  <p>But the chiefeſt obligation the quality of being Members of the Son of God exacts from us, is to expoſe our life for his Glory, as he expos'd his for our ſalvation. Nature and Politicks teach us the juſtice of this duty, and we need only conſider how the members carry themſelves toward the Head, and ſubjects demean themſelves towards their Soveraigns, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is our duty towards Jeſus Chriſt. Though every part of the body love its own preſervation, carefully avoiding whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereto, and by a naturall providence abominates whatever may any way annoy it; yet from a higher principle 'tis informed that its life depends upon the Head, and that 'tis oblig'd to expoſe its ſelf in his defence. Thence it comes to paſs that the hands ward the blow which is aimd at the Head; that they readily oppoſe themſelves to the danger that threatens it, and forgetting their proper intereſts ſacrifice themſelves for the preſervation of this Chief. Thence it is that ſoldiers jeopard their lives in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel of their Soveraign, ſlighting the hail of Muſquets, the brunt of Pikes, and the Thunder of Canons to augment his Glory or widen his State: They are never more valiant then when his Perſon is in danger; the greatneſs of the hazard heightens their courage, and opinion or nature perſwades them that living more in him then in themſelves, their death is leſs conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then his. Many times it fals out that he for whom they ſacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is ſome old Dotard, ſpent with labour and age, and hath but a few moments to live; In the mean time, becauſe they know he is the ſoul of the State, and the Head of his ſubjects, they are perſwaded they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves in dying in his defence; and imagine that as Fathers live again in their children, the members receive a new beeing in their Head. This Paradox finds belief amongſt all complexions; there is not the meaneſt ſoldier but ventures his life upon this Maxime, and I rather
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:115672:80"/>conceive their courage quickned by this conſideration, then by the hope of profit and reputation, becauſe all men are neither ambitious nor covetous: but all being members of the State, are inſtructed by nature to die for the defence of their Head.</p>

Though perſecution doe not exerciſe the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the Martyrs, and the peace the Church enjoys ſuffer not the Faithfull to expoſe their lives for the quarrel of Jeſus Chriſt, they ceaſe not to be obliged to this duty in a thouſand opportunities; if occaſion preſent not it ſelf, they muſt preſerve a will to it; if they cannot ſuffer death, they muſt ſuffer ſhame and confuſion for his glory; and when the world ſhall overturn the maximes of the Goſpel to ſet up the maximes of Libertiniſme or Impiety, then is it that Chriſtians muſt call to mind that they are the Members of Jeſus Chriſt; that they muſt prefer his intereſts before their own honour, and if they be ſo happy as to ſacrifice their lives for the defence of their Head, they muſt be ſo ſtout as to ſacrifice their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, who requires this duty of them as the ſureſt teſtimony of their love.</p>

                  <p>AS Mans Body is the perfecteſt Image of the Church: the Members that compoſe it are alſo the livelieſt repreſentatives of Chriſtians: Both of them live in unity, depend of the ſame Head, and are inform'd with the ſame Spirit; Both of them preſerve their differences in their Unity, and exhibit in their mutuall correſpondence that agreeable vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety that ſets an eſtimate upon all the works of Nature. Though theſe My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and Naturall members conſpire altogether for the publick good, they ceaſe not to have their different employments; Each particular acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its capacity: they never treſpaſs one upon another, and as there are none uſeleſs they have all their ſeverall functions which they exerciſe without confuſion and jealouſie; their faculties are anſwerable to their employments: Nature gives every one what is neceſſary for them to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her orders, and Grace never refuſes the others what they ſtand in need of to operate according to its motions; But the moſt wonderful reſemblance I find between the members of theſe two Bodies, is, that their good and bad occurrences are common, and that living in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſociety, no ſad diſaſter happens to one but all the reſt are affected with it: One ſole blow makes a thouſand wounds at once; and though there be but one part ſet upon, all the reſt teſtifie their compaſſion.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115672:81"/>ſenſible of all the miſeries of the meaneſt of their ſubjects: the Heart,

                  <p>If all things were well regulated in the Church, if the Faithful acted according to the motions of Grace, and if Charity, that combines them together, were as lively in their Hearts, as in thoſe of the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we ſhould ſee in the myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, what we behold every day in the natural body of Man: The affliction of one of theſe quickned Members would equally touch all the reſt; every one would do his office according to his power; and imitating the good intelligence of parts compoſing the ſame body, ſome would weep as the eyes, others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain as the mouth, and others aſſiſt as the hands. This certainly was the conſideration that wrought ſo much upon S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s affections,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Docet utique Paulus ſaue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem, patitur ſua &amp; aliorum ſimul mala, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitates tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat &amp; ſolatur, ſimul de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniſalute, &amp; de toto orbe ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitus.</hi> Anſel.</note> and obliged him to pronounce thoſe words flowing from the greatneſs of his love: <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi> For as he came neerer Jeſus Chriſt then other Chriſtians did, being cloſer united to this Head, he ſunk deeper into his minde; and remembring the complaints he himſelf had drawn from his mouth, when he perſecuted the Church, he endeavoured to repair that offence by compaſſion; and in Mercy to imitate him, whom he repreſented in Authority. All Chriſtians are bound to live in this diſpoſition; if they mean to ſatisfie their duty, they muſt be afflicted with the miſerable, weep with thoſe that weep; and calling to minde that they are the Members of the ſame Body, they muſt ſee no Innocents perſecuted, no Godly diſtreſſed, but they muſt do their utmoſt to comfort them, by condoling their misfortunes. 'Tis perhaps for this reaſon, that the Church is called a Dove, becauſe ſighs are as natural to her, as to that Bird, who having loſt her mate, ſpends her life in grief and ſolitude: The Church is a widow, and conſequently ſolitary: her Husband left her, when he aſcended up to heaven: and though ſhe be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with his preſence, being deprived of his ſight, ſhe cannot ſecure her ſelf from that anxiety her love works in her, but ſhe mourns as the Dove, becauſe, being made up of as many Members as ſhe hath Believers, ſhe is conſtrained to give her ſelf over to Sorrow, when ſhe ſees them in Calamity or in Danger.</p>
                  <p>Having conſidered the Afflictions of the Church, let us conſider the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her Joy, and behold the community of Goods ſhe hath ſet up among her children, in that which Nature hath erected among members
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115672:82"/>of the ſame body. The union of theſe later is ſo great, that though they have different offices, yet ceaſe they not to take pains one for the other. The eyes ſee, and hear not, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> the ears hear, and ſee not; the hands act, and hear not; the feet walk, and act not: nevertheleſs their correſpondence is ſo good, that the eyes hear by the ears, the ears ſee by the eyes, the hands walk by the feet, and the feet act by the hands: ſo that if we ask the ears, Can they judge of Colours? they would anſwer, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the unity of the body, they are always with the eyes; and if they ſee not themſelves, they are inſeparable from thoſe whoſe office it is to ſee for them: Thus, continues S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as the eyes ſay we hear by the ears, and the ears, We ſee by the eyes, and both of them, We act by the hands; all is common among theſe parts; their difference deſtroys not their unity; and though their employments be divers, they live in ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a ſociety, that the advantages of the one part, make up the riches of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>If Chriſtians be Members of Jeſus Chriſt, they enjoy the ſame privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; all their goods are common; and, if envie divide them not from their Head, they poſſeſs in Him, whatever is wanting in Themſelves: The Alliance they have with his Body, enriches them with another's good, without any injuſtice; and like the members of a man, which act in one anothers behalf, they foretel things to come, by the mouth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; they are underſtood of all Nations, by thoſe that have the gift of Tongues; they work miracles, by the hands of the Apoſtles; and they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to themſelves, without vanity, whatever the Saints are able to do in the myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt: For one of the ſecrets of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is, that the relation of the members is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that each particular labours not ſo much for it ſelf as for others. The eye is the onely part that can ſee; but it ſees not for it ſelf alone; it is the candle of the feet in their walking, of the hands in working, and of all the other members in their employments: Indeed, if it diſcover any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger threatning the foot, it endeavours to protect it; and gives notice, that it may be avoided. The hand acts onely, but not for it ſelf alone; it defends the face if ſtricken at, courageouſly oppoſeth any enemy that braves it; and knowing that their intereſts are common, valiantly ſuffers the evil, to deliver the body from it. All the members are ſilent; there is none but the tongue that ſpeaks; but ſhe is their interpreter, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them with words to expreſs their like or diſlike, their ſorrow or joy. Thus muſt we confeſs, in the myſtical body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no benefit which is not reckoned as pertaining to the reſt: If they be prudent, 'tis to counſel the ſimple; if they work miracles, 'tis to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Infidels, or to confirm weak Believers; if they have the ſpirit of Prophecie, 'tis to inſtruct the ignorant; if they have the gift of Tongues, 'tis to make ſtrangers underſtand them, and to gather up the children of God that are diſperſed thorow all the world.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:115672:82"/>
                  <p>But that which exceedeth all belief, is, that the particular graces that ſanctifie mens ſouls, are common among the Faithful. For of theſe Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie acknowledgeth two ſorts; one, which are given us for the ſervice of others, and reſpect more the benefit of the Church then our own ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; ſuch are all thoſe graces that are called Gratuities, whoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end is the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, and the converſion of Infidels; ſuch is the gift of Miracles, which doth not ſo much profit him that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, as thoſe who ſee the effects of it; becauſe we know very well, that this priviledge, though extraordinary and rare, may conſiſt with ſin, and, if it be not accompanied with much humility, is as dangerous as ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did: The other ſort of Graces are thoſe that make us acceptable to God, blot out our offences, look more to our own ſalvation, then that of our neighbour; and being not ſo glittering as the other, are incomparably more holy and uſeful. Now though theſe laſt kinde of graces be our own, yet alſo are they common in the Church; and thoſe that are united to us by charity, may in ſome ſort make uſe of them. 'Tis certainly upon this ground, that the great Apoſtle calls this vertue <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it not onely aſſociates all Chriſtians, but renders their graces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and enricheth every particular with the advantages of the whole fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity: Therefore was <hi>David</hi> bold to entitle himſelf to all the good works they did that kept the commandments of God: <hi>Particeps ego ſum omnium timentium te, &amp; cuſtodientium mandata tua:</hi> For though he knew very well his condition would not ſuffer him to be always at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that the cares that accompany Royalty agree not with the ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements of ſolitude, and the bloody exerciſes of war gave him not leave to attend the ſervice of the Ark; he hoped nevertheleſs that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which united him to the Faithful, would make him partaker of their merits; and being a Member of that myſtical body, he ſhould enjoy their Graces, that made it up with him: Thus this great Prince, ruling in his Palace, or fighting in his Armies, promiſed himſelf a ſhare in the Sacrifices of the Prieſts, in the Tears of the Widows, in the Illuminations of the Prophets, in the Crowns of the Martyrs; and that Love ſupplying the defect of his condition, enriched him with their vertues, without impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhing them.</p>
                  <p>This alſo was the counſel S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gave the Faithfull of his time: for knowing that every Chriſtian could not have all graces,

His words are too handſome to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Envie not, ſaid he, to the whole company of the Faithful the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages your neighbour poſſeſſeth, but holily rejoyce in them, and ye ſhall
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115672:83"/>enjoy them with him. Say not in your heart, Were I indeed a Chriſtian, and had I the honour to belong to Jeſus Chriſt, I could do that which others do, and inſtead of being engaged in the bonds of Marriage, I would live a holy Celibate: For, 'tis juſt as if the ear ſhould ſay, I am not of the body, becauſe I cannot ſee the light of the Sun: in the mean time, the hand hath not that priviledge, no more then the ear; and yet they are parts of the body as well as the eyes; becauſe, though every member can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do that by it ſelf which all the others do, they ceaſe not mutually to aſſiſt each other, and to poſſeſs that in common, which they call their own properly. After their example, be glad of that grace God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon any of the Faithful; and you may do that in him, which you are not able to perform in your ſelves. He keeps his Virginity; love him, and you are continent with him: you have the gift of Patience, by learning to ſuffer; let him love you, and your patience ſhall become his: He can faſt, and your conſtitution will not give you leave; love him, and his faſting ſhall be yours. If you ask me how this can be: 'tis becauſe he lives in you, and you in him, and you are both members of the ſame body: for though ye be different in condition and in perſon, by charity ye are but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot <hi>Guerric</hi> certainly grounded himſelf upon this Maxime, when he ſaid that all vertues were common among Believers; that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church was open to all her children; and that when our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or our weakneſs did not permit us to practiſe one vertue, we fail not to practiſe it in another:

In the mean time we commit this crime againſt the myſteries of Faith; we would make Religion a Science, and we daily ſearch for evidence and certitude in the region of ignorance and obſcurity. The deſire we have to fathome the depths of Predeſtination, is a certain proof of this Inſolence: For though there be nothing in the world more bid, more in the dark, there is not any thing man hath more curiouſly examined, and made the employment of his buſie undertakings, ſeeking his fall in the fountain of ſalvation; I ſhould account my ſelf very happy, could I cure him of this malady; and if deſcribing the myſtery hidden in eternity, could make him ſee, 'tis an impiety to pretend to know more then God hath been willing to reveal.</p>
                  <p>Predeſtination is as certain as it is ſecret, it makes up one part of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and if God have any care of his creatures, he muſt needs lead them to their end. There are none but the Epicures, who fearing to trouble his reſt, have denyed him the knowledge of humane affairs: The beſt of Philoſophers have believed our fortune is in his hands, and that having given us our beeing, he muſt alſo give us our felicity.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtian Religion hath confirmed us in this Creed, and Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading us that God hath regulated all things from Eternity, obligeth us to believe that he hath ordained neceſſary means to aſcertain our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:

                  <p>Reaſon together with Faith inſtructs us, that God loves all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that his being Abſolute, makes him not unjuſt, and acting accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the knowledge of the Cauſe, he puniſheth none that have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it; If he be no more liberall in his recompenſes, then ſevere in his corrections, he fails not to be very obſervant of Juſtice; if we be not ſure that he hath reſpect to our merits, we know at leaſt that he hath to his own favours: and that when he crowns our good works, he crowns his own benefits and endowments.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture that knows very well that men are in love with their ſalvation, and jealous of their liberty, repreſents them often that God is abſolute in his State; that he is not to give account of his actions; that his judgments being equitable in themſelves, have no need of our approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor are therefore leſs juſt, becauſe not conformable to our weak reaſonings. This divine Regiſter inſinuates to us, that God is the maſter of his creature; that he diſpoſeth thereof as he pleaſeth, and that if Nothing whence he had his Beeing give him right enough to deſtroy him;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115672:85"/>ſin which he is guilty of gives him title enough to puniſh him. But delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all theſe reaſons in different paſſages, we are not permitted to deduce thence infallible conſequences; nay, we may eaſily perceive the whole drift is rather to humble then inform us.</p>

It appears alſo more ſevere in that it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115672:85"/>lays Gods refuſing Grace not upon ſin, but upon Nothing; nor grounds this ſentence ſo much upon the Juſtice of God, as upon his Soveraignty: For 'tis ſome comfort to the creature to know that God reprobated him not, but by conſequence of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion; that he is not out of his favour, but becauſe he is the iſſue of his enemy: nor that he is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Heaven, but becauſe his Father ſhut the door againſt him.</p>
                  <p>There are other Divines who taking things another way, are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that God ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath a mind to ſave all Men: but having created them free, hath given them ſufficient graces, the uſe whereof depends upon their own will: This opinion hath more aſſertors then both the others, and if it were lawfull to reaſon in Religion, I ſhould ſay, 'tis of all the moſt reaſonable; But neither condemning nor appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, me thinks it hath no ſuch ground in Scripture, giving God rather a meer naked preſcience, then an intire diſpoſall over his creature; that it exalteth Liberty above Grace; making man the Authour of his ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it takes not ſufficient notice of the devaſtations ſin hath made in our nature, and judgeth as favourable concerning a Criminall as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: It makes me queſtion Grace in rend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Church which is the Spouſe of Chriſt hath not yet perhaps light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make a ful diſcovery of this Truth. The Apoſtles her Maſters have ſpoken but ſparingly therof; they have been content to inſinuate the power and the juſtice of God, that we ſhould not be ſo raſhly inſolent as to aſcribe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115672:86"/>our ſalvation to our ſelves, and impute our fall to him: When they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw our objections and our doubts, they anſwered them only with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; and paying us with that ſolution Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the <hi>Pelagians</hi> that urged him cloſe, they have taught us this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that there is more to be adored then to be known in this ineffable my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; That in this occaſion a man may boaſt his ignorance, nor know which ſide to take without running the hazard of being accounted raſh and unadviſed; Finally, that the ways we take to diſcover the will and mind of God, are in ſome ſort injurious to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>For we limit the knowledge of the Almighty, and ſet down Inſtances wherein he ſees ſome things, and not others; we make him reaſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our manner, and we preſcribe him principles, whence we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him to draw conſequences that pleaſe us; we conſtrain him to ſave and deſtroy men according to the motions of ſeverity or pity which ſway us; and not knowing that his juſtice is tranſcendently above all our Laws, we go about to reduce him to the conditions of Judges or Soveraigns.</p>
                  <p>I honour the Fathers of the Church, who to quel Hereſies, have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced certain Maximes upon this ſubject of Predeſtination: I reverence whatever the Church obliges me to believe of the Juſtice or Mercy of God; I adore with the Scripture all the judgements of my Creator; &amp; whether he founds his refuſal of Grace or Glory upon my Non-Entity, or upon my Sin, I bleſs his juſtice; if he chuſe me upon ſight of his own favours, or my merits, which are but the effects of his favours, I will magnifie his mercy; and not examining either his motives, or queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his power in the diſpoſall of his creatures, I will patiently ſubmit to the Eternall determination of his Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>Upon the conſideration of theſe verities the Chriſtian muſt live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hope and fear, that ſeeing himſelf ſuſpended between Heaven and Hel, he may ſigh out after his Redeemer; and finding no firmer aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance then in ſubmiſſion to his grace, may yeild full obedience to it, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly longing that it may grow more vigorous, that ſo it may exerciſe an abſolute dominion over his will; never fearing to loſe his liberty by yeilding ſubjection thereto; but inſtructed by the language of the Church, beg of God that grace may become Miſtreſs of his heart, that it may vanquiſh his reſiſtance; and making ſtrength ſucceed ſweetneſs, may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over a rebel that diſputes the victory with him.</p>
                  <p>I know very well this ſubject cauſeth much bandying in the Schools, that it divides the Maſters of Divinity, and troubles the peace and fair intelligence with which they ought to inquire after Truth. But for me, I find them agreed in the moſt materiall circumſtances; and that in the diverſity of their opinions, they can neither be ſuſpected of Errour nor Raſhneſs.

                  <p>'Tis upon theſe two Principles, as upon two immoveable Poles, that I make this whole Treatiſe roll; wherein I profeſs to take S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for my guide; but proteſt withal, that in ſeeking after Truth, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways endeavoured to preſerve Charity; and am ſo far from blaming thoſe Opinions I do not hold, that I am ready to relinquiſh mine own, when the Church ſhall condemn them, or when her Governours ſhall oblige me to change them. Hitherto, both Opinions have ſeemed Orthodox: The Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> hath authorized them, leaving them in the Church; and hath ſuffered the Faithful to embrace that which they ſhall judge moſt conformable to Scripture, and the holy Fathers. The Canons of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly are compoſed with ſo much prudence, that, condemning the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that divided the unity of the Church, it hath determined nothing concerning the Controverſies of the Divines: It hath ſo judiciouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained it ſelf, that each party alleadgeth it for themſelves; and by the carriage of the buſineſs hath made us ſee, that tacitely it gave approbation to both theſe Opinions, which for twelve Ages have buſied the beſt Wits of the School. For though ſomething be added to that which ſeems leaſt conſonant to the doctrine of S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> there is no change in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and 'tis the ſame that ſo many Biſhops and Doctors have taught heretofore in the Pulpit and in the Chair.</p>
                  <p>After the example of this great Councel, I honour both the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and expecting till the Church ſhall further explain her ſelf upon theſe matters, which produce ſo many gallant Pieces on one ſide and the other, I will content my ſelf in ſaying, that in each party there is ſomething to be done, and ſomething to be left undone. For, thoſe who will not that Grace have ſo abſolute a dominion over the Will, ought to labour hard, becauſe believing their liberty not ſo maimed, but that it may with a little aid practiſe Chriſtian vertues, they are obliged to produce notable effects, and to carry heaven by violence, and the aſſiduity of an unceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant endeavour: But they muſt withal carefully avoid Pride, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies bold undertakings: They muſt remember, all their pains will be fruitleſs, if they be not quickned with Grace; they muſt be ever mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of thoſe words of Jeſus Chriſt, who confounding the vanity of men, hath obliged his diſciples to confeſs, that after all their travels, they are
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115672:87"/>unprofitable ſervants: They muſt conſider, that whatever ſhare their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty may pretend in the buſineſs of their ſalvation, they can do nothing without his grace who ſaid to all his diſciples in the perſon of his Apoſtles, <hi>Sine me nihil poteſt is facere.</hi> The diſciples of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the weakneſs of Nature, and the power of Grace, are engaged to pray much, to depend upon the mercy of God, and to cry aloud with the Pſalmiſt to their Divine Redeemer, <hi>In manibus tua ſortes meae;</hi> but leſt the fear of their Infirmity ſhould lull them aſleep in the lap of Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are bound to joyn Action to their Prayers, good Works to their Sighs; remembring that Charity is active, and that ſhe never hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Deſires and Wiſhings, but when ſhe is deſtitute of occaſions to ſuffer or do for the glory of him whom ſhe ſo paſſionately affects.</p>

                  <head>The Second DISCOURSE. <hi>Of the Neceſſity of Grace in the ſtate of Innocence; and of Sin.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>A Man muſt be an enemy to his Salvation, that is an enemy to the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe, in whatever ſtate the creature is conſidered, he hath need of ſome ſupernatural aſſiſtance to attain to glory. His weakneſs is ſo great, and his end ſo high, that he can neither maſter the firſt, nor compaſs the ſecond, if he be not aſſiſted with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſuccour. Original righteouſneſs that furniſhed him with ſo many advantages, gave no diſpenſation from this neceſſity; and though he had neither Paſſions to combat, nor diſorders to regulate, Grace was ſtill neceſſary for him to overcome Temptations, and to perſevere in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence: Had Humane nature continued, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie condition God at firſt created it in, it had been unable to preſerve it ſelf, had it not been upheld by the power of its Creator.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of Grace is more delicate then that of Nature; and if all Philoſophers confeſs that the Creatures have need of the ſupport of the Almighty, that they return not to their Nothing, all Divines acknowledg they have need of his help, leſt they fall into Sin. Weakneſs, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from the Creature, puts him in this neceſſity; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe many priviledges his production was honoured with, he cannot want that ſuccour which ſupports and fortifies him. <hi>Adam</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but a ſmall time in his original righteouſneſs; his firſt conflict was followed with his overthrow; and we know not whether his Creation and his Fall happened not on the ſame day: but this we know, that his Fall had
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115672:87"/>been ſpeedier, had not Grace ſeconded his Liberty; and that he had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from his End aſſoon as ever he had known it, had he not been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with ſupernatural Means to tend thereunto. And me thinks we may apply the words of the Scripture in the ſtate of Innocence as well as of Sin, and ſay with that excellent Doctor of Grace, <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord.</hi> For as there is no Creature can begin any good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace, neither is there any that can perfect that good beginning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                  <p>The Neceſſity of Grace is ſo great,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non talis facta eſt Natura, ut ſine Divino ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutorio poſſet manere.</hi> Aug.</note> that 'tis common to all ſorts of conditions: Angels can no more be without it then Men; the nobleneſs of their Creation diſpenſeth not with them: and if it be true that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity of their nature, being higher then that of Men, makes them more indigent of the aſſiſtance of God, I conceive their elevation in Grace renders them more neceſſitous of its ſupport. The Greatneſs of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſerves onely to abaſe them; their excellence is a glorious ſervitude; the more they have received from God, the more do they depend upon him; and the grace that would preſerve an Angel, would not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to preſerve a Seraphim. Thus the dignity of the Creature is as well a proof of the Neceſſity of Grace, as his weakneſs: and till he be admitted into Glory, where he findes his confirmation in Good, he ſtands in need of Grace to preſerve thoſe advantages he hath received from his Creator.</p>
                  <p>If Innocence could not free us from this happie Neceſſity, we may ſay 'tis increaſed upon us by ſin; and, that to give us a releaſe, we have need of ſome more vigorous and active Grace: For, 'tis not enough now, that it ſhew us the Good, and enable us to attain unto it, but it muſt withal inſpire us with a Will unto it; it muſt lead us by the hand, ſupport our weakneſs, order our doings, correct our imperfections, break our chains, and maſter concupiſcence that takes poſſeſſion of our Will: It muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault this Tyrant, to ſet us at liberty; that dealing skilfully with us, and valiantly againſt it, we may be delivered from ſervitude, without any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to our nature. For Free-will is ſo weakned by ſin, that it cannot ſo much as will the Good, if Grace cure it not: it muſt change its inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to elevate its deſires; and imprint upon him the love of vertue, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to abhor vice. Indeed, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> how ſhould a man live juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he be not juſtified? how ſhould he live holily, if he be not ſanctfied? and how ſhould he live truely, if he be not quickned with Grace, which is the true life of the ſoul? The Cure of man, and his Diſeaſe, depend not equally upon his Will: there needs nothing but a ſmall exceſs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a Fever: hot and cold are able to debois our conſtitution: Fruits eaten unſeaſonably, or exceſſively, may cauſe a Flux: nor is there any man ſo well, but may be ſick when he will: But the Cure depends upon Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; we muſt recover that by the help of another, which we have loſt by our own fault; and experience teacheth us, that the end of evil is not in our power, as its birth is. We may reaſon thus concerning Man a Sinner,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115672:88"/>becauſe ſickneſs is as well the Image as the Puniſhment of his crime: he may ſin when he will; he hath liberty enough to become a delinquent; there needs no temptation to make him ſwerve from his duty; and he is dextrous enough, by his ſole power, to render himſelf miſerable. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt Grace, he cannot recover it by his own proper Will: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the abilities ſtill remain with him, there will never be enough to raiſe him from his Fall; nor can he be juſtified by any other then by him that is the fountain of all the Juſtice in the world. The Law that was given to Inſtruct him, is not ſufficient to Cure him: though it be one ſtep to arrive to vertue, and the knowledge of ſin be neceſſary for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, nevertheleſs the Law, without Grace, cannot convert the ſinner; its light ſerves onely to dazzle him, its defence onely to irritate his deſires; and when this feeble ſuccour is not ſeconded by Grace, it makes a man but more guilty. 'Tis Charity that inſpires a love towards the Law, that ſurmounts its difficulties, changeth its pains into pleaſures; and of ſlaves making children, renders that eaſie and agreeable, that ſeemed burdenſome and impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>But when, by the mediation of Grace, a man paſſeth from the Law to the Goſpel, he ought not to think this guide uſeleſs, nor that he can without its aid preſerve, what without its light he could not attain. Grace is not leſs neceſſary to finiſh then to begin; and the new ſtate whereto the Chriſtian it raiſed, depends ſo abſolutely upon its influences, that he ceaſeth to act, when this ceaſeth to operate.</p>
                  <p>For the right underſtanding of this Truth, we muſt remember, that though the Chriſtian and the Man be one and the ſame perſon, yet have they their oppoſitions and their differences: Man believes himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, when he is free and reaſonable; theſe two faculties are his principal advantages; and the vanity of Philoſophy perſwades him, that as long as he acts according to Reaſon, he cannot fail of attaining felicity: To keep himſelf in this ſtate, he is careful that the Senſes pervert not his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the Paſſions trouble not his Reſt, and an inordinate Love deprive him of his Liberty: But this blinde Opiniator ſees not that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his enemy in his own boſom, that Concupiſcence orders all the motions of his ſoul, that Reaſon is but her ſlave, and that he is never more wedded to himſelf, then when he thinks to hang looſe from all things elſe.</p>
                  <p>As the Chriſtian is a new man, he acts by other principles: for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Reaſon, to give himſelf over to Grace; he quits the light of his Underſtanding, to ſubmit to the obſcurity of Faith; and his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is to quench the flames of Self-love, that he may burn onely with the fire of Charity: He learns in the School of Chriſtianity, that Reaſon is a bad guide, becauſe ſhe lets Concupiſcence lead her; he knows that the Underſtanding is prevented with a thouſand errours; and having loſt the better part of his light, he many times confounds Vertue with Vice: He is not ignorant that the Will is the moſt depraved, as it is the moſt guilty
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115672:88"/>of all his faculties; and being engaged in the love of the creatures, finds nothing that charms the affection, but what is corruptible and periſhable; Therefore is his greateſt care to get aſſiſtance againſt theſe domeſtick ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and wholly to ſurrender himſelf to grace, that it may be to him for a guide and a defence. Thus Faith becomes his Light, Hope his Supporter, Charity his Love, and if we may ſpeak ſo, Grace is made his ſecond Nature. To the vain errours of Science, he oppoſeth the ſolid lights of Faith; to the falſe promiſes of the world, the true promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt; to ſelf-love, divine love; and to the corruption of Nature, the purity of Grace. Then is it that ſoaring above himſelf, he learns by a happy experience, that he was never more free then ſince he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſlave; and that Grace is ſo far from robbing him of his liberty, that it hath delivered him from a bondage as cruell as it was ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, Free-will finds its perfection in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; he that was in darkneſs becomes enlightned; from weakneſs he paſſeth to ſtrength; from diſorder, to good government; and he that was ſullied with the love of the creatures, recovers his purity in the love of the Creator.</p>
                  <p>But nothing more obliges the Chriſtian to renounce his reaſon, that ſo he may become the ſubject of Grace, then to know that his laſt end is ſupernaturall, and that he cannot attain it by forces ſolely naturall. For though man have ſome knowledge of God, though he obſerve his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections in the creatures, though he judge of his greatneſs by the beauty of his works, and recoiling into himſelf, ſees there ſome ſhadows of him whoſe image he is; yet he knows very well that God is ſo great, that he cannot be perceived but by his own light. Indeed he muſt ſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ſome rays into our ſoul, that the ſoul may have ſome glympſe of him; he muſt clarifie and ſtrengthen her, that ſhe may look up unto him, and mounting above her ſelfe, may render her partaker of that light, whereby he is made viſible to the bleſſed in glory. Thus though the will have ſome affection for the Supream Good, though ſhe cannot fixe upon any objects that have not ſome appearance of Goodneſs in them, and that in the midſt of her greateſt diſorders there ſtill remains ſome inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards her Creator; yet the Chriſtian knows that God cannot be worthily embrac'd but by that love he works in us; that charity muſt be poured into our hearts; and that without the aſſiſtance of this Divine gift, we can neither love him nor hate our ſelves as we ſhould. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination Nature ſtamped upon us in her purity, was too weak to effect this; and that which Nature hath left us ſince her corruption, is too inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to lead us to it. Thus Grace is neceſſary in both conditions, and the actions that proceed not from this Principle, are to be ſuſpected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to the Maximes of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> thoſe that flow not from Charity, flow moſt commonly from Concupiſcence. Theſe two Soveraigns poſſeſs the will ſucceſſively: as the firſt works nothing but
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115672:89"/>good, the ſecond is only active in evil; and to be diſingaged from the tyranny of the one, there is no other way but to ſubmit to the lawful dominion of the other. Thence it comes to paſs that the ſame Doctor declaring his full judgement in that Epiſtle he writ to <hi>Vitalius,</hi> informs us, that Grace depends upon Gods pure Liberality; that 'tis due neither to Men nor Infants, though it be neceſſary to all the actions of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; that God who is the Author of it, reſpects neither their works nor their diſpoſitions; that men may know when he beſtows it, 'tis an emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his mercy; and when he denies it, 'tis an act of his juſtice: He that ſhall well weigh the ſenſe of theſe words, as profound as the depths he treats of, will not have much adoe to acknowledge the indigence of the creature, the need he hath of Grace, and the Liberty God reſerves to himſelf of diſpenſing it to whom he will.</p>

                  <head>The Third DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Grace of a Chriſtian ought to be more powerfull then that of</hi> Adam.</head>
                  <p>IT is ſtrange, but withall very true, that nothing ſo much hinders a man from valuing the remedies that cure him, as the opinion he hath that he was not very ſick. This is it that to this day abuſeth the greateſt part of Chriſtians, and leſſens the obligation they have to the Grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: For they are perſwaded that the fault of our firſt Father hath ſcarce made any devaſtations in our Nature; that the greateſt part of our evils ſpring not ſo much from our will, as from our imagination; and that there is little difference between the ſtate of ſin, and the ſtate of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall righteouſneſs. Pride inſenſibly confirms us in this belief; we make our weakneſs paſs for cowardiſe, nor can we be brought to acknowledge that our paſſions are the puniſhment of our diſobedience. From this firſt Errour is derived a ſecond more troubleſome then the former: For believing our diſeaſe light, we think the remedy extream eaſie; and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Concupiſcence not ſo ſtrong, we judge the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt nothing ſo powerful. Indeed thoſe that imagine that mans liberty is yet vigorous enough to reſiſt ſin, acknowledge only a ſufficient grace, adding little to that of <hi>Adam,</hi> depending upon our will, as well as that did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his: They make us the maſters of our ſalvation; and not conſidering the terrible enemies we have to combate, they think our weapons need be no better furniſhed then thoſe of the firſt Man. Therefore I cannot eſtabliſh the neceſſity of efficacious Grace, but I muſt deſcribe the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115672:89"/>of our nature, that the greatneſs of our diſeaſe may make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the excellency of the remedy. And indeed 'tis one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt reaſons Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> made uſe of, to make the <hi>Semi-Pelagians</hi> underſtand that the ſuccours which were ſufficient for man an Innocent, could not be ſufficient for man a Sinner: He handles theſe two ſubjects without dividing them; he oppoſeth Concupiſcence to Charity, and founds the ſtrength of Grace upon the weakneſs of corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Man in the ſtate of Innocence was well with himſelf, becauſe he was ſo with God; his fleſh was obedient to his ſpirit, becauſe his ſpirit was obedient to him that created it; Originall righteouſneſs was a ſacred chain which link'd the body to the ſoul, and the ſoul to God: ſo that having no domeſtick enemies, he had but forainers to combate; But when ſin had deſpoiled him of grace, he ſaw himſelf ſwallowed up by his own paſſions, and juſtly condemned to ſuffer the eternall pain of his diſobedience: From that houre he began to be criminall and miſerable; the parts that compos'd him were divided; and Original righteouſneſs the bond of their amity, having abandoned them, their love was changed into hatred: 'Twas in this ſad moment that Nature loſt her primitive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that ſhe that was ſubject to Grace, became captive to Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence; from which inceſtuous mixture, thoſe monſters received birth that bid us battle.

                  <p>'Tis true, that as ſin hath corrupted nature, whereby ſhee is at a great diſtance from this acceptable condition, wherein ſoul and body conſpired together to make man happy; The Grace of Jeſus Chriſt muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be far different from that of <hi>Adam;</hi> it muſt have more light, becauſe it is to enlighten one blind; more force, becauſe it is to cure one diſeaſed; In the ſtate of Innocence it was ſubject to the will of man; he made uſe of it according to his pleaſure, becauſe having as yet no bad inclinations, there was no inconvenience but his ſalvation might depend upon his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and he be in ſome ſort the maſter of his happineſs. Heaven never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him relief; he found aſſiſtance in all his deſigns, and being not yet criminal, Grace was offered to him at every moment: As it was always preſent with, ſo was it always at his devotion; he might accept or refuſe it, and in this happy condition he was ſo free, that his ſalvation and his

For what can be hoped for from a creature that more follows the motions of concupiſcence, then the impulſes of charity, were there not ſome commanding Grace that became the Miſtreſs of his heart, and carrying him to good with as much force as ſweetneſs, gained him a ſure victory over his enemies?</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it that the Great Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> to whom all the ſecrets of Grace were known, repreſents it to us under the name of a Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Suavity, which gently maſters the will by its affectionate allurements, leading her ſo ſecurely amidſt the throng of precipices, that ſhe runs leſs hazard in the world, then our firſt Father did in Paradiſe: For though he had nothing to fear but his weakneſs, experience made him ſee 'twas e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to deſtroy him; and that 'twas eaſie for him to tumble into a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, whence an Angel that was more vigorous, knew not how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf: But though in the ſtate of ſin, rebellion ſhare the forces of man, though Concupiſcence divide his will, he knows very well that when Grace clears up his underſtanding, he cannot miſtake; and when it inanimates him, he cannot be worſted.</p>

                  <p>I know there are a ſort of new Divines that ſeem to place Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence in man an Innocent, not exempting him from that inteſtine war whereof the Saints complain; who are perſwaded that original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did not accord the two parts that compoſe man; and that their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion contributing to his glory, ought alſo to contribute to his merit.

If they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, She requeſts not that the Faithful be delivered from it becauſe bad, but becauſe dangerous; by the ſame reaſon they muſt deſire that they had neither eyes nor hands, becauſe both theſe parts are of ſad conſequence to ſinners. If they ſay they pray not for the full ruine of it, but for its diminution; they muſt confeſs, that if what they would pare away be hurtful, it ought not to be in <hi>Adam,</hi> nor could now be cured by his grace. For, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſays excellently well, the grace of <hi>Adam</hi> was the grace of a man ſound and free, and the grace of Jeſus Chriſt of a man a captive and diſeaſed: this produceth two effects in his perſon; it reſtores his health, before it give him ſtrength; it breaks his fetters, before it makes him walk; and ſuppreſſeth his diſorders, before it makes him act.</p>
                  <p>This Truth will be better conceived, if we compare the Liberty of <hi>Adam</hi> with the Servitude of Man a ſinner; that by the difference of theſe two ſtates, we may judge more eaſily of the difference of their graces. <hi>Adam</hi> was as Free as Innocent; nothing reſiſted his Will in his perſon;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115672:91"/>and the Paſſions having not as yet ſhook off the yoke of Reaſon, troubled not his Reſt: he acted with tranquillity of minde; he found his pleaſure in his duty; nor was he ſenſible of any internal rebellion impeaching his liberty. Thence it came to paſs that his grace was ſubject to his Will, that he uſed it according to his deſires and his occaſions, either to obey his Soveraign, to command his Subjects, or to reſiſt his Enemies. But the ſinner fallen from this glorious condition, is the ſlave of him that hath conquered him; he ſerves as many Maſters as he hath Paſſions; and he findes to his coſt, that to puniſh his diſobedience, all his ſubjects rebel againſt him. The grace of <hi>Adam</hi> would be uſeleſs in this condition; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not fully free, he could not make uſe of it; and being the ſlave of ſin, in whoſe poſſeſſion he is, he would employ it rather to his own ruine, then to his ſalvation: Grace muſt ſet him free, before he can work; muſt break his chains, before he can fight; and reſtore him his liberty, before he can form one good deſigne. This is it that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teacheth us in that Chapter where making the Antitheſis of Man a Sinner, and Man an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, he ſaith, This had a grace great indeed, but much different from ours: For he lived in the advantages he had received from his Creator, and of his goodneſs held that happie condition that exempted him from all our evils: But the Faithful, to whom this grace appertains that delivers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, languiſh in misfortunes that make them ſeek after Liberty: <hi>Adam</hi> in the midſt of the innocent delights he taſted, had no need of the death of Jeſus Chriſt; but the Chriſtians cannot be waſhed from their heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or acquired ſins, but by the blood of the Lamb ſlain for their ſalvation: <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood not in need of that aſſiſtance his children require, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing the revolt of the Fleſh againſt the Spirit, they complain of the Law of Sin that oppoſeth the Law of God; and by the mediation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, beg ſtrength to combat, and ability to overcome an enemy whoſe aſſaults <hi>Adam</hi> was never ſenſible of: For he was not divided in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; but enjoying a profound peace, he ſaw not his body warring againſt his ſoul, nor one part of himſelf unjuſtly lifting up the heel againſt the other.

For, whatever arts we uſe to exalt the happie
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115672:91"/>condition of <hi>Adam,</hi> we muſt confeſs his grace was weak, becauſe it could not maintain the freedom of his Will; and, leaving him to himſelf, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his enemy to foil him: But the grace of Jeſus Chriſt makes us victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the midſt of our infirmities, aſſures our ſalvation among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtormings of Temptations, and ſeizing upon our heart, makes us triumph over the world.</p>
                  <p>When I conſider the deplorable condition of a ſinner, me thinks Jeſus Chriſt had a minde to humble him by lifting him up; and that he might profit by his loſs, to make him finde his greatneſs in his abaſement: For 'tis indeed to take man down, to ſubject him to grace, to deprive him of the diſpoſal of his Will, and to uſe him as a ſlave, who is no longer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his own perſon: But 'tis alſo to lift him up, to endow him with a victorious grace, which confirms his liberty, makes him conſtant in good, and in deſpight of all his weakneſſes, gives him ſo much vigour and ſtrength, that he meets no enemies he does not vanquiſh, nor any temptations he does not overcome.</p>
                  <p>But admit all theſe reaſons did not clearly conclude for the neceſſity of Grace, I conceive Predeſtination would always be a moſt evident proof: For ſeeing it is true that God is immutable in his Decrees, that the deſigns he hath laid from all Eternity, are not changed in Time,

                  <p>THough Man have very many proofs of his Weakneſs, yet hath he more of his Ignorance: he knows not that which he ſees, and that which he touches: his Senſes are better ſighted then his Underſtanding; and they judge more ſurely of their objects, then the Intellect does of his. The Qualities of things cloud their Eſſences; every Accident is a veil caſt over the eyes of the Soul; and he undergoes all the troubles in the world, to finde the Sun of Truth amidſt the Shadows that cover it: But his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is never more evident then when he ſeeks for the laſt differences of things; he changes upon all occaſions; the more he goes on, the more he wanders; and finding no tracks that may ſteer him in an unknown path, he many times takes Falſhood for Truth. Thence it comes to paſs that we are acquainted with nothing but the Accidents or Proprieties of things, and that we fall into Errour as often as we intend to judge of their Eſſences. There is nothing more known to Chriſtians then Grace; a man muſt be a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> to doubt of its vertue: all our prayers are teſtimonies of its neceſſity; and when we intreat of God to enable us to perform what he commands us to do, we ask Grace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Every one confeſſeth, there are two kindes of Graces in Chriſtianity: One Habitual, that gives the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian his ſupernatural being; that lifts him up to the participation of the Divine Nature; and making him an Image of Jeſus Chriſt, makes him Man and God together: The other Actual, which elevates him in his operations, makes him act heavenwards, and renders his works holy and acceptable before God: But few know wherein conſiſts the power of this Grace, what that is, which, without forcing our Liberty, makes it irreſiſtible in its deſignes.</p>
                  <p>The diſciples of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> believe Grace effectual becauſe it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of God, raiſing and determining the Will as often as he moves and applies it.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115672:92"/>Thence it comes to paſſe, that he inlightens with the Sun, burns with the Fire, reaſons with Man, acts neceſſarily with neceſſary Cauſes, and freely with free Cauſes; Thence it comes to paſſe alſo, that he is free in the world, that nothing is done contrary to his directions, and that applying the creatures in their operations, ſees all his deſigns infallibly ſucceed. For theſe Divines believe not that any thing is to be permitted to Fortune in the Kingdome of Providence; nor that the knowledge of God is to be ſubmitted to the capricious fancies of his creatures. Therefore doe they put into his hands the reins of his whole Empire: they will have him give motion to all his ſubjects; to apply them in their operations, and without offering them any violence, execute his will by their inclinations. If he abandons neceſſary Cauſes, they produce Monſters; if free Cauſes, they commit ſins; and when he guides both of them in order of Nature or of Grace, they are regular in their motions, and happy in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions: But being the Principle, the Glory belongs to him; and the effects they produce ought rather to be aſcrib'd to his Influence, then to their Vertue. This Predetermination of the creature in a ſupernaturall order, is called <hi>Effectuall Grace</hi> among the Diſciples of Saint <hi>Thomas:</hi> and they are ſo wedded to this opinion, that they believe a man cannot diſſent from it, without renouncing the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> overturning the order of Nature, robbing God of his Soveraignty, and taking from him the infallible knowledge of all events that happen in his State: They ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think to weaken the liberty of man by eſtabliſhing the Providence of God, becauſe they know his concurrence hath no leſſe ſweetneſs then force; and that he ceaſeth not to act winningly, notwithſtanding he acts abſolutely. They believe alſo God no ways injures the creature, if he leave him to his infirmity, becauſe owing him nothing, he may let him fall when he will; and that it is mercy and not juſtice when he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafes to uphold or lift him up.

                  <p>Some other Divines to whom this opinion ſeems too ſevere, place the power of Grace in the conſent of the creature; and will have, that God more tender of our ſalvation then of his own glory, preſents Grace to all men: and that it depends only upon their liberty to receive or reject it. This aſſiſtance hath no more vertue then the law; it ſhews the evill, but cures it not; it forbids ſin, but gives no ſtrength to avoid it; it clears the underſtanding, but changeth not the will; it ſolicits not this, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it illuminates that; and as if men had kept all their libertie ſince their fall, it tries to diſſipate their darkneſs, without taking the pains to break their fetters. This Grace thus conceived, is but a weak light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it leaves all Infidels in their Errours; and a vain perſwaſion, becauſe it leaves ſo many Chriſtians in their ſins: Nevertheleſs according to their Creed, 'tis ſufficient to ſave all men, provided they will; and as if their liberty had not been infeebled at all by Originall ſin, they can make uſe of this Univerſall Grace, work out their ſalvation with it, draw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115672:93"/>out of the number of the Reprobate, and paſs into that of Elect. It ſeems this Grace is not much different from that which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> oppoſed, when he ſaid theſe words to the <hi>Pelagians:</hi> If we have the power to conſent, why does the Apoſtle teach us that 'tis God that works in us to will? I know ye will anſwer, he works in us by his Law: in obeying which, we make it efficacious; and in reſiſting, render it uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and unprofitable. But if all be as you ſay, you condemn all the Prayers of the Faithfull, you blame the cuſtome of the Church: For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'tis in our power to conſent when we liſt, 'tis to no purpoſe to pray that we may doe it; and ſince having the knowledge of good, 'tis in our own power to perform it, 'tis in vain that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> requeſted Grace for the Faithfull, who were already enlightned. In the mean time, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that 'tis of God to prepare the will, he addes Prayer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; having exhorted them to depart from ſin, he endeavours to divert them by his ſupplications, and to obtain that for them, which he had formerly taught them.</p>
                  <p>But as I write not ſo much to confute the opinion of others, as to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh my own, I leave every man the freedome to follow his own ſenſe in this particular; and content my ſelf to make it appear, that Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> was never of this judgement concerning Grace. And indeed there are few Divines that embrace the opinion I am about to deliver; it was ſtifled in the very Birth as Monſters are; and though it flatter liberty, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it the Miſtreſs of ſalvation, it muſt be ſweetned to give it ſome cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit among the Faithfull.</p>
                  <p>Behold therefore the temperament the new Divines have reduc'd it to, thereby to give more to Grace and leſſe to Free-will.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115672:93"/>to her by his inſpirations, and ſhee gives no ear; he diſcovers her his Beauties, and ſhe contemns them; he preſents her his Favours, and ſhe mindes them not: Seeing her rebellious to his will, deaf to his intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as if he could not be obeyed without offering her violence; and conveying heat into the will, as well as light into the underſtanding, he hath recourſe to Stratagems; he endeavours to ſurpriſe her that he cannot overcome; he wins her heart by her ears, nor triumphs over her liberty, but by her humors or her inclinations. But certainly Love ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made the Almighty loſe his Majeſty, but in the Myſtery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; when he deals with his creature, he always keeps his State; his being a Lover, makes him not forget that he is a Soveraign; and when he intends to deliver a ſoul from the ſlavery of ſin, he employs graces ſo ſweet and ſo ſtrong, that as he no ways wrongs the liberty of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo neither doth he prejudice his abſolute Power. He knows very well that ſin gives him a new right over men; that he may refuſe them grace without any injuſtice; that he ſaves a Delinquent when he ſaves a Saint: and that the merits of his Son being not applyed to men but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleaſure, take not from him the power abſolutely to diſpoſe of his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>To give my judgement therefore of theſe three opinions; Me thinks the firſt more reſpects the Majeſty of God, then the Liberty of Man; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes Laws to him which in truth are not unjuſt, but ſeems a little too ſevere; lifts him not high enough above the reſt of creatures, and though it leave him his liberty, conſiders not ſufficiently the dignity of his extraction: For it ſeems God deals with Men as with the Elements, that he makes ſcarce any difference between Angels and Beaſts; and that this Soveraign governs ſo abſolutely in his State, that he much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards his own glory then the welfare of his ſubjects: He determines alſo free creatures as well as neceſſary; if he oppreſſe not their liberty, he takes no pains to gain it; and more ſolicitous to make himſelfe obeyed, then loved, he maſters the will rather by force then ſweetneſſe. The ſecond paſſeth into another extream, and ſeems to be ſo carefull of the ſalvation of man, that it neglects the glory of God, makes his grace a bondage, opens heaven to all the world: makes Mercy ſparkle abroad to the detriment of Juſtice; aſcribes more to liberty then to grace; renders man inſolent ſince his Fall; will have him as familiar with God ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, as during his innocence: Imagines that nature received no ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes by ſin, and that the will under the thraldome of Concupiſcence, is as vigorous as under the Empire of Originall righteouſneſſe. The third handles Grace a little more reſpectfully then the ſecond; 'tis me thinks a bold opinion, but not impudent, it covers ſelf-love under honourable pretences; it beſtowes that upon the Mercy of God, that it takes from his Juſtice; it intitles not liberty ſo abſolutely to ſalvation, but it preſerves the rights of Grace; which if it make not victorious, it makes at leaſt wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed;

But certainly, 'tis very difficult to comprehend what is that ſecret vertue that imprints this power in the Loadſtone: The whole Body of Philoſophers have troubled themſelves to no purpoſe to diſcover it, whatever pains they have taken; and whatever watchings they have ſpent in this ſtudy, they have not to this day been able to find out the occult cauſe of ſo evident an effect; they are ignorant whence this ſympathy between the Loadſtone and the Iron grows, nor can they render a reaſon why this ſtone attracts this metal and not others; they know not whether this attraction have more of ſweetneſs or of force, whether it draw the Iron by affecting it, or by forcing it, and whether it complies with its inclination, or over-bears its weight and obſtinacy.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid of the Loadſtone, may as truly be verified of Grace: Its power is ſo publick, and its attempts ſo common, that there is no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but knows and admires them; It triumphs daily over the liberty of ſinners, lifts theſe wretches from the Earth, enlightens the blind, ſoftens the obdurate, converts the obſtinate, and ſubdues theſe rebels: But
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:115672:94"/>though all the Faithful acknowledge a vertue whoſe effects they reſent, they know not preciſely wherein it conſiſts; they are divided in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: and though they all take S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for their Maſter, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves in ſuch different terms, that though taught in the ſame School, it ſeems they have not all learnt the ſame Leſſon.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as this incomparable Doctor is pleaſed in all his Works to break forth in commendations of Grace, conſacring all his Labours to the glory of that which drew him out of his ſin; he ſometimes admires its Force, and ſeems to place all its vertue in its invincible puiſſance: he will have it the miſtreſs of hearts, ſtrongly over-ruling the Will of ſinners; and like a Soverain, more reſpecting her own Majeſty, then the Inclination of her ſubjects: Sometimes he changeth his language; and meditating rather to preſerve the Liberty of Man, then the Power of Grace, he ſeems to place its vertue in its compliance, he repreſents it to us as a ſweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion; flattering man, to gain him; ſetting upon him where he is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to overcome him; ſtudying his inclinations, to make him in love; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his meaning, to accommodate it to that of its own; and like Lovers, who become complacent onely to become abſolute, ſtoops to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſinner, to triumph over it; nor is his ſlave, but to become his miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he walks between theſe two Extremes; and joyning force with ſweetneſs, he ſpeaks of Grace as of a victorious complacency: he deſcribes her as a Queen diſplaying her Beauty as well as her Power, to keep her ſubjects in obedience: and knowing that Nature hath given her as many Allurements as ſhe hath done Forces, unites both together, to tame the rebels of her State: She imitates the conduct of Providence, whereof ſhee is an emanation; and mingling Sweetneſs with Authority, executes her deſignes, leading men whither ſhe pleaſeth. Theſe three manners whereby S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> expreſſeth himſelf in his Writings, have produced three Opinions in the Church, which acknowledge him for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, boaſting to be of his minde, and to ſtand to his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is that which is aſcribed to S. <hi>Thomas;</hi> which delivering it ſelf in terms very ſignificant, but ſomewhat barbarous, placeth the power of Grace in Predetermination. Thoſe that hold this Opinion, will have God always preſerve his Soveraignty when he deals with the Creature,

                        <hi>Voluntas Dei eſt prima &amp; ſumma omnium cauſa.</hi> Aug. lib. 3. de Trin.</note> applying him as he will; and uſing rather compulſion then fair means, diſcovers a deſire rather to be obey'd then lov'd. He acts ſo powerfully, that all his deſignes are accompliſhed: he toucheth the Will of Man with ſo much energie, that he maſters it; and makes that blinde faculty ſo ſenſible of his Authority, that acknowledging him for her lawful Soveraign that ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth her, ſhe loſeth all deſire of reſiſtance, and accounts it her happineſs to yeeld obedience. Theſe Divines borrow the terms of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to explain themſelves; and taking advantage of whatever he hath ſaid in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the power of Grace, ſay that ſhe is invincible in her deſignes;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115672:95"/>that ſhe findes no oppoſition in her ſubjects; that ſhe manageth the hearts of men as ſhe liſts, bending their Wills without conſtraining them; that ſhe acts ſo abſolutely, that ſhe changeth their reſolutions, and of rebels makes them loyal and obedient ſubjects. They ſtick to all thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes uſe of to ſet an eſtimate upon the power of Grace; and they are ſo afraid leſt gentle uſage bring ſome prejudice to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of God, that they ſeem to have neglected the liberty of Man.</p>
                  <p>Nothing more detains them in theſe manners of ſpeech, then a belief they have that no operation of God, though never ſo ſtrong, doth ever oppreſs the liberty of the Creature: In a word, though he act ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he ſtill preſerves the intereſt of his workmanſhip; he never deprives him of thoſe perfections he once endowed him with; and as he neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moves neceſſary cauſes, ſo he alſo freely moves free cauſes: whatever impreſſion he makes upon them, he never ſtorms them; and as there is nothing more natural to the Creature then to obey his Creator, ſo is there nothing leſs violent.

The ſame may be ſaid ſome way proportionably of Man; as his inclinations are not more natural to him, then theſe qualities to the Elements, God may change them without doing him any violence, and raviſh his heart without intereſting his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si ergo cum voluerit reges in terra De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us conſtituere, magis habet in poteſtate volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates hominum quam ipſi ſuas; quis alius facit ut ſalubris ſit correptio, &amp; fiat in correpti corde correctio, ut cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſti conſtituatur in regno?</hi> Aug.</note> Thus we ſee that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith ſo often, That Grace worketh in us to will, That it gains our conſent, overcomes our ſtanding out, and, by a wonderful effect of its power, makes us hate thoſe things we loved, and love thoſe things we hated; That, finally, its impulſes are ſo ſtrong, that when they are received into our heart, we muſt infallibly obey; and yeelding to his omnipotence that drew us out of nothing, we voluntarily paſs from Death to Life, from Rebellion to Obedience. Though this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion aſcribe ſo much to the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, it takes from it the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal advantage; and ſpeaking nothing of its Sweetneſs, the better to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh its power, greatly diminiſheth the eſteem due unto it: For Men being paſſionate of their Liberty, cannot relliſh that which ſeems to weaken it; the ſhadow of bondage checks them; and this abſolute Empire of the Creator over his Creature, inſpires them rather with Rebellion then Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſome other, willing to preſerve Mans Liberty, have leſſened the power of Grace: they place its vertue in its accommodation; and rendering it rather compliant then victorious, make it not raign ſo much by power as by ſtratagem: They will have Jeſus Chriſt, when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the converſion of a ſinner, chuſe the moſt opportune moments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the inclinations of his enemy, ſearch among his treaſures of Graces thoſe that are moſt ſutable to this rebels humour; and, that he may not
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:115672:95"/>force his Will fit himſelf to his condition and temper: They are afraid leſt giving too much authority to Grace, they ruine the Liberty of Man; and, to avoid this misfortune, they reconcile them ſo well together, that 'tis hard to judge which of the two is miſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> furniſheth them with words and reaſons for their defence; his firſt Writings are much in their favour; and before he was to cope with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> ſaid very much in their behalf. For as this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor hath combated all the Hereticks of his time, hath buckled with the <hi>Manichees</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> he hath changed his Batteries according as he changed his Enemies, and ſeems to employ other Principles againſt the <hi>Manichees</hi> then againſt the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> When he deals with the firſt, he attributes much to the liberty of man; he makes it not onely the ſource of ſin, but of good works; and to hear him ſpeak againſt theſe Hereticks, Grace ſeems not ſo much the handmaid, as the miſtreſs of the Will. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was advanced to a Biſhoprick, he had opinions which afterwards he retracted; and being as humble as he was learned, he knew that he had attributed too much to the Will, and too little to Grace: But alſo we muſt confeſs that he writ ſome things in thoſe times that he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted; and though he ſpake afterwards more ſtoutly, he ſeems to have left his diſciples the liberty of chuſing in his Writings thoſe opinions that ſeem moſt reaſonable: For this great man would never tyrannize over the ſpirits, never would he make himſelf Head of a party; and excepting thoſe things he believ'd matter of Faith, he never forced any man to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Judgement.</p>
                  <p>Though therefore he quitted this opinion, he condemned it not; and thoſe that embrace it may boaſt themſelves the diſciples of this great Doctor: beſides that in his laſt Works he uſeth ſome terms that ſeem to favour it: For he makes as if he placed the victory of Grace in its aptneſs, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it victorious as far as 'tis agreeable, and agreeable as far as ſutable to the ſinner: He compares it ſometimes to thoſe Potions that are bitter to a ſick perſon, becauſe their mouthes are out of taſte, and which muſt be dulcorated by ſome artiſice, that they may be taken: He confeſſes, writing againſt <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that the ſweet elapſes of Grace conſiſt in this agreement, which makes it entertained by the ſinner; and that, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its effect, it muſt have ſome reſemblance with the inclination of him that it would maſter. <hi>Procul dubio,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſuavitatem ipſa congruentia facit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as in this Opinion Liberty ſeems ſtill the miſtreſs of Grace, and that ſhe reſerves a right to uſe it at pleaſure: There is a Third Opinion made up of the two former, taking and leaving ſomewhat of both. From the firſt it takes that Force it acknowledgeth in Grace, and rejects that imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous power that converts the Will in whatever diſpoſition it findes her: For thoſe that fully div'd into the meaning of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> have obſerved that the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, though always effectual, is not always victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:115672:96"/>and though it never fail to produce ſome holy deſires or good motions in the ſoul of a ſinner, yet it ſurmounts not always the illigiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate pleaſure that holds her captive; ſo that its manner of acting dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers very much from Phyſicall predetermination, which ever tames the will, notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance ſhe can make. Finally, this third opinion takes and leaves ſomething of the ſecond; it takes that ſweetneſs that charms the will of man, and confeſſeth all the force of grace to conſiſt in that ſuavity that accompanies it: but it rejects that lazy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance that ſubjects grace to liberty, making man in ſome ſort the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his ſalvation; it cannot allow that our conſent ſhould more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon our ſelves then upon grace: and that acting in the ſtate of ſin, as if we had acted in the ſtate of innocence, we ſhould rather diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of grace, then grace of us.</p>
                  <p>To explain therefore the power of this Divine influence according to the moſt common opinion and moſt conſtant with S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> it conſiſts me thinks in a certain ſweet elapſe, ſhedding it ſelf into the will, charming it ſo agreeably, that 'tis tranſported by it, doing nothing but by the motion of this ſuavity, which becomes infallibly victorious, ſurmounting the delectation that captivated the will. If it produce not always this laſt effect, it fails not to produce ſome others. For if it diſingage not the ſinners ſoul, it breathes into him ſome deſire of his liberty, imprints ſome motions into him that make him ſigh; if it breaks not his chains, it ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the weight of them, and enables him to form ſome good deſigns, or conceive ſome good wiſhes. But whatever man does, 'tis grace ſtill that makes him doe it; it is more the principle of his action then himſelf: and ſeeing it produceth in him according to the language of the great Apoſtle, both to will and to doe, he is obliged to ſay with the ſame Apoſtle, that he owes all that he is, and all that he doth to Grace, and that the glory he expects, is rather the reward of grace, then of his merits.</p>
                  <p>From all this Diſcourſe 'tis eaſie to judge that this laſt opinion compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the two other; that it unites force with ſweetneſs in grace; that it may prevail upon man without wiolence: It reſpects the Majeſty of God, becauſe it gives him the abſolute diſpoſall of his creature: it ſpares the liberty of man,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Certum eſt nos velle cum volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ſed ille fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit ut velimus bonum; certum eſt nos facere cum facimus, ſed ille facit ut faciamus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendo vires effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciſſimas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntati.</hi> Aug.</note> becauſe it ſubjects it only to pleaſure, which is never more welcome then when forc'd: and gives it a ſhare in the work of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe it confeſſeth with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that he acts with the grace that makes him act: <hi>Ageris ut agas, &amp; bene agis ſi à bono aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There remains one difficulty which I am content to propound without reſolving: To wit, whether Grace always mingle force with ſweetneſſe to convert a ſinner, or to guide a juſt perſon; for it ſeems there are ſome ſouls that God deals roughly with, which taſte no inward ſweetneſſe at all: and deſtitute of all delectation, act only by the ſtrength and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of their grace. They are continually plunged in grief and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115672:96"/>they may beſpeak God as <hi>Job</hi> did in the midſt of his afflictions, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus es mihi in crudelem;</hi> and they may boaſt with the Apoſtle, that all their ſtrength conſiſts in their weakneſs: <hi>Tunc potens ſum cum infirmor.</hi> I know very well that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> never ſeparates force from ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in grace, and that where ever he deſcribes it victorious, he deſcribes it agreeable. But may we not ſay alſo, that this great Doctor hath ſpoken of Grace, as he had experience of it himſelf; and being diſingaged from ſinfull pleaſures by innocent ones, believed all graces ſweet: and that the particular conduct God had obſerv'd towards his ſoul, was his generall proceeding with all others. In a word, Myſticall Divines and Spirituall Guides ſeem to acknowledge ways wherein God ſeparates light from force, and force from ſweetneſs, though in both theſe he faile not to promote ſouls in piety. But becauſe Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath given no notice of them in his works, let us hold our ſelves to his conceptions, and ſay, that if there are graces where light and force are more ſenſible then ſweetneſſe, there are none where ſweetneſs is not mixt with force and light, and the ſweetneſs ſo much more effectuall, that being more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, 'tis leſſe known to the underſtanding and more remote from ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>Foraſmuch as God hath made man free, never taking that from him w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> once he hath beſtowed upon him; he could not have employed a more gracious, nor more effectuall way to gain him, then pleaſure: All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are taken with it, and the Poet had reaſon to ſay, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not ſweetly maſter'd by pleaſure. The Ambitious ſeek not ſo much the reputation in honours, as the pleaſure, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn them aſſoon as they ceaſe to be agreeable. The Covetous is not ſo much provoked with profit, as pleaſure in the deſire of wealth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſpends many times prodigally to procure other things that more delight him; Nay, the Laſcivious wanton, is not ſo much in love with beauty as with pleaſure, becauſe he placeth his affection ſometimes upon objects that have no appearance of beauty, and many times for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes a handſome woman to court a deformed one; Thus pleaſure is a powerfull charm, that maſters all hearts, plunders liberties, and makes ſlaves that never complain of their bondage, becauſe they are volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Lovers that ſeek the ſecret of purchaſing affection, ſtudy nothing but complacency, being aſſured they ſhall produce love in that heart where they have begot pleaſure. Flatterers never inſinuate into the minds of great men, but by rendring themſelves acceptable; nor doe their falſe Commendations ſteal in at the ears, but becauſe pleaſure takes up the place of truth. The very Devils, though our mortall enemies ſeduce us not, but becauſe they pleaſe us; and had they not found out the art of mixing pleaſure with ſin, all their temptations would be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. But the will of man, though never ſo free, hath ſuch an inclination toward pleaſure, that did ſhe never ſo ſtrongly barracado her ſelf, ſhe could not poſſibly reſiſt it: ſhe holds out againſt truth, becauſe ſhe is blind and ſees not the beauties 'tis adorned with; ſhe ſecures her ſelf againſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, becauſe ſhe is free, and naturally oppoſeth whatever ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon her liberty; ſhe does not acquieſce in reaſon, becauſe ſhe is deaf; nor hears any diſcourſe but ſuch as charms the underſtanding by convincing it; But pleaſure hath allurements which ſhe can no wayes withſtand: ſhe trembles when ever it ſets upon her, ſhe is afraid to loſe her liberty in his preſence; and knowing the power it hath over her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, ſhe cals in ſorrow to her ſuccour to guard her againſt this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing enemy.</p>
                  <p>If it be true, that pleaſure reigns abſolutely over the will, we need not think it ſtrange that grace which is nothing elſe but a victorious ſuavity, hath ſuch advantage over her; for beſides, that this Heavenly influence ſurpaſſeth all the delights in the world that charm us, having more allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then glory and beauty that makes ſo many Lovers and Martyrs, it

Scripture is never more eloquent then when it intends to expreſs the force thereof: nothing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies it in this deſign; all words ſeem too weak to expreſs its conceptions, and finding no compariſons that anſwer the dignity of the ſubject, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends to the Tombes, where having conſidered the Trophies of death, is forc'd to confeſs that his power equals not that of Love: it paſſeth to the very Center of the Earth, obſerves the unrelenting hardneſs of Hel, and comparing the pains of the damned with the anxiety of lovers, leaves us in doubt whether Hel or Love be more pitileſs.</p>
                  <p>But not to aggravate his power by ſuch ſtrange compariſons, let it ſuffice to judg of him by his effects: Though he be the ſon of the Wil, yet is he the Maſter; he diſpoſeth ſo abſolutely of his Mother, that ſhe hath no motions but what her Son inſpires her with: ſhe undertakes nothing but by his orders; 'tis the weight that ſets her a going; the Loadſtone that attracts her; the King that governs her; and ſhe ſo abſolutely depends upon his power, that nothing but another love can diſ-engage her: ſhe is ſo fierce or ſo free, that neither violence nor fear can tame her; ſhe laughs at tortures, preſerves her liberty in the midſt of fetters, and many times torments make her but more wilfull: Only Love mollifies her hardneſs, his charmes gain upon her what ſorrow cannot, and experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, there is no ſurer Command then that which is founded upon Love.</p>

But God, who hath formed the heart of man, and knows how they may be vanquiſhed without being forc'd, owes all his Conqueſts to his Love; he never appears more abſolute, then when he tames a rebellious Will, when of an Enemy he makes a Lover, and, changing his inclinations, ſweetly compels him to fall in love with him.

                  <p>I am not afraid to injure mans Liberty in uſing terms ſo ſignificant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſuppoſing Grace nothing but Love, it can do no violence to the Will: for, of all the things in the world, there is none freer then Love: A man cannot complain that he is forced, when nothing but charms of affection are employed to gain him: and if there are ſome Lovers that have blamed the rigour of their miſtreſſes, there is none that have found fault with their love: If it be an Evil, 'tis a voluntary one; it hurts none but thoſe that willingly embrace it; and of ſo many puniſhments that torment us, there is none more innocent, becauſe none more free: Crowns may be ſnatched from Soveraigns, Confidence may be taken from Philoſophers, Orators may be convinced, any man may loſe his life; but whatever ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems are made uſe of, whatever violence men practiſe, a Lover cannot be forced, nor his love extorted from him.

                  <p>If Grace cannot force our Will becauſe it is a victorious love, it ought leſs to conſtrain it; becauſe, according to the language of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> 'tis a pleaſant perſwaſion: For this great man conſidering that he was to deal with Free-will on one ſide, and the Power of Grace on the other; that he was to maintain the Empire of God, and the Liberty of Man; he hath always expreſt himſelf ſo happily, that he never prejudic'd either: and as indeed Grace never forceth Man, but perſwades him, it holds ſomething of Eloquence or of Reaſon that triumphs over Liberty without

                  <p>In a word, Eloquence may boaſt her ſelf a Soveraign that reigns with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms, ſubdues people by her word, convinceth Philoſophers by her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſubjects Monarchs by her power: She protects the Innocent, comforts the Diſtreſſed, condemns or abſolves the Guilty; and as ſhe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the Advocates or the Judges, produceth different miracles in their ſouls. Whether ſhe inchant the Ears by the harmonious cadencies of her Periods, whether ſhe excite love and hatred by her geſtures, her principal deſigne is to maſter the Liberty of Man. She ſets not upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but to gain the Will; ſhe appears complacent, that ſhe may be perſwaſive; nor doth ſhe require the attention or her auditors, but that ſhe may get their conſent: 'Tis true, never any man complains of her violence, becauſe ſhe is ſweet; and he that hath changed his minde at the hearing of an Orator, never accuſed him of Tyranny. 'Tis certainly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ground that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls Grace a powerful perſwaſion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, imitating Eloquence, it clears our Spirits, calms our Paſſions, and gains our Conſent: It hath this advantage over Eloquence, that it hath no need of our Ears to win our Hearts; it tranſmits it ſelf, by it ſelf, into the inmoſt receſſes of the ſoul; findes out Reaſon in her Throne, without employing the Senſes; carries Light into the Underſtanding, and kindles Love in the Will. Thus ſhe perſwades what ſhe will to the obſtinate, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues rebels without arms, makes her Subjects will what ſhe deſires they ſhould; and when ſhe diſplays all her forces, ſhe works the converſion of a ſinner in a moment. This certainly was the power Jeſus Chriſt made uſe of, when he laid Saint <hi>Paul</hi> flat at his feet, when he converted that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor into an Apoſtle, changed his heart and his tongue, and made him that breathed nothing but murder, ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> He loſt not his Liberty, for having loſt his Fury; he changed not his Nature, for having changed his Judgement; nor can we ſay that the perſwaſion that gained his conſent, was leſs free or more violent for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo ſudden. Grace knows how to be obeyed, without making us ſlaves; ſhe can perſwade without compelling, and, more powerful then Eloquence,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115672:100"/>is able to make us love what we hated before. That great Orator that guided the Romane Common-wealth with his Tongue, and made his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo dexterouſly paſs into the ſoul of his Auditors: that gallant man, I ſay, hath wrought miracles by his Eloquence, which we have much ado to allow the grace of Jeſus Chriſt to effect. He could boaſt that he altered the reſolution of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> defending the cauſe of <hi>Ligarius;</hi> that he ſhook the papers out of the hands, and the hatred out of the heart of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; that he made him recal the ſentence he had already pronounced in his ſoul; that he overcame him by his Reaſons, that fubdued all by his Arms; and trampled upon the pride of a Tyrant that had triumphed over the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the mean time, we have much ado to believe that Grace can work miracles; we weaken its Vertue, to preſerve our own Free-will: we are not content that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be as powerful as an Orator: and when we hear of theſe victorious Graces, and of theſe invincible perſwaſions, we imagine as if there were a deſigne to oppreſs the publike Liberty: Let us aſcribe that to Grace, which we grant to Eloquence: let us confeſs that the Son of God knows how to imprint Truth in our ſpirit, and Love in our heart, to perſwade us infallibly: let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he is not to ſeek by what ſtratagems to gain our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that his Grace, more intimate then Concupiſcence, is able to become the miſtreſs of our Wills; and whatever command ſhe exerciſeth over us, ſhe never deſtroys our Liberty, becauſe ſhe hath no other deſigne then to enfranchiſe it out of ſervitude.</p>

Though ſhe exerciſe ſo abſolute a power over his perſon, ſhe ſo well tempers ſweetneſs with force, that he never complains of his bondage: he loves the Tyrant that devours him, he loſeth his liberty with pleaſure, he findes content in his vaſſalage, and, what is more unconceiveable, he makes haſte to a precipice, and embraceth death with ſatisfaction, whenever this cruel Soveraign commands him. 'Tis in effect Concupiſcence that obligeth the Covetous to paſs the Seas, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the depths, and to ſurmount all dangers that accompany the ſearch of riches: 'Tis ſhe that engageth the Ambitious in ſuch deſperate deſigns, where death is always mixt with glory, and where a man muſt reſolve to kill or be kill'd, to purchaſe reputation: 'Tis ſhe that imbarks the laſcivious in their infamous purſuits, where ſhame is the inſeparable attendant of pleaſure, where a man muſt loſe his own liberty to attain that of another, and become a ſlave, that he may be a maſter. In the mean time, if we ask all theſe Martyrs of Concupiſcence, we ſhall ſee by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, there's not one of them that groans under his irons, that's troubled for the loſs of his honour or liberty, nor makes the leaſt attempt to break thoſe chains that fetter him: Had Tyrants but found this artifice, they would raign more abſolutely then Kings; and making Love ſucceed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, they would be the delight of their Subjects: But nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence hath diſcovered this Secret, which according Sweetneſs with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, knows how to make her ſelf belov'd and obey'd by ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs we muſt confeſs that Grace is as abſolute over Chriſtians; and taking pattern from the proceeding of Concupiſcence, reigns over them with as much power as love.

                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> will explain theſe Truths to us better then another: Let us make up this Diſcourſe with his Reaſons,

Grace is not onely a Light that clears the Underſtanding, as Faith or Doctrine doth; her Charity is accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Force; ſhe produceth two effects at the ſame time: For having taught us the good, ſhe gives us power to perform it; and he that knows it, and does it not, cannot boaſt that he hath received it of Grace, but from the Law: Therefore is it that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaith in S. <hi>John,</hi> that he that is taught of his Father, fails not to come unto him. <hi>Omnis qui audivit à Patre, &amp; didicit, venit ad me.</hi> Whence S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that he that is inſtructed in this School, always goes to Jeſus Chriſt; and he that goes not, never had the Father for his Maſter. For Grace warms the Will, at the ſame time it enlightens the Underſtanding; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys light and heat both together; and working two miracles at one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fortifies our Weakneſs, and warms our Coldneſs. Her manner of acting is much more excellent then that of Precept, or of the Law: For theſe two Miſtreſſes ſtrike onely the ears or the eyes; they inform not our judgement but by the mediation of our Senſes; and though they enlighten the Underſtanding, they change not the Will: But Grace works by an occult power in the hearts of men, producing there not onely true illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but good and conſtant reſolutions. And becauſe the <hi>Pelagians</hi> always confound Doctrine with Grace, to weaken her vertue, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwers them, that, would they chriſten her with that name, they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a wonderful Doctrine that God ſheds abroad internally in the ſoul with an ineffable ſweetneſs, which taught not onely Truth, but infuſed Charity into its diſciples.</p>
                  <p>He more ſtrongly eſtabliſheth this Maxime, in explaining that paſſage where S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>God worketh in us to will and to do:</hi> we will, ſaith this great Doctor; for we are not liveleſs trunks, or ſenſleſs rocks; but God produceth in us this will: we act; for we ought not to be unprofitable; but God produceth in us this action, according to his good pleaſure: we are bound to ſay it, and to believe it; 'tis piety to promote it, that we may with all humility confeſs that all we do is rather of God then of our ſelves. He ſays the ſame thing again, ſpeaking of Perſeverance, and perſwades all the Faithful that their ſalvation ought to be founded upon their humility, becauſe God hath indued them with Graces whereby they are made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his power and their own weakneſs: For he will not have the Saints glorifie themſelves for their perſeverance in good out of their own abilities, but from the aſſiſtance of his Grace; neither hath he given them a ſuccour equal to that he beſtowed upon the firſt man, whereby he might have perſevered if he would; becauſe foreſeeing that they would
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115672:101"/>not perſevere, had they not from him the power and the wil, he hath given them both out of his pure mercy.</p>
                  <p>Indeed their will is ſo effectually warm'd by the holy Spirit, that they are able to doe the good, becauſe they wil, and they will it, becauſe God hath inſpir'd them with a will to it: For did God abandon them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this infirmity, which ſerves as a remedy againſt their pride, and did he give them no other aſſiſtance but that by which <hi>Adam</hi> might have perſevered if he would, they would ſtoop to the aſſaults of temptations in the frailty of their fleſh; nor would they ever perſevere, becauſe the weakneſs of their will would not ſuffer them to will the good at all, or to will it ſo ſtrongly as to doe it. Therefore God deſiring to ſuccour their miſery, hath given them a grace that ſo moves this rationall faculty, that ſhe never reſiſts it; that in her weakneſs ſhe may be vigorous enough to ſurmount all the adverſities of life. But becauſe theſe manners of ſpeeches might perſwade the ignorant, that a grace that acts ſo energetically would deſtroy liberty, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> inſtructs us, that her force conſiſts in her ſweetneſs, that ſhe works upon the will only by the pleaſure ſhe there produceth; nor that ſhe is victorious, but becauſe ſhe is agreeable.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond truth that remains to be proved, to ſatisfie my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to manifeſt the laſt reſemblance between Concupiſcence and Charity: Though the former be ſometimes ſo violent that ſhe hardly leaves the ſinner any liberty to reſiſt, ſhe never employs force to extort his conſent: ſhe is not of the humour of thoſe tyrants, which make uſe of nothing but torments to reduce their ſubjects to their deſigns, and knowing that Empires are preſerv'd by the ſame means they are acquired, endeavour to keep that by cruelty they have gotten by violence: But ſhe corrupts the wil by pleaſure, propoſing nothing but what is delightful; ſhe dexterouſly mixeth ſmiles with frowns, profit with loſs, glory with ſhame, and ſo artificially diſguiſeth the objects ſhee preſents ſinners with, that they complain not even in the midſt of their torments: 'Tis ſhee that ſweetens the laborious travels of Conquerors, charms the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Covetous, comforts the Laſcivious in the tortures that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company their wantonneſs: ſhe gilds the chaines of al lthe ſlaves that follow her, makes them acceptable, when ſhe cannot make them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, ſowing pleaſure where ſhee cannot ſow profit nor reputation: Thence it comes to paſſe that her Empire is ſo firmly eſtabliſhed among finners, that to deſtroy it, grace muſt change their wils, ſubduing the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their criminall pleaſures by the truth of her innocent delights.</p>
                  <p>For ſhe walks in the ſteps of her enemy; ſhe imitates her ſhe intends to ruine, and benefiting by her wiles, ſhe never ſets upon the will of a ſinner, but ſhe is ſeconded with pleaſure; her chiefe Stratagem is to render vertue agreeable, to take off that auſterity that ſuffers her not to be accoſted, and to lay all her Stoicall moroſity upon the face of ſin. This is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> declares by thoſe words, where he exhorts a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115672:102"/>to be converted: Confeſs your ſelves ſaith he in the preſence of? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and you ſhall obtain from his bounty, that the vertue which ſeem'd ſo ſtern, will ſeem ſweet and eaſie: When he hath wrought this firſt miracle, you ſhal finde that facil which now you apprehend as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; you ſhall have as much ſatisfaction in juſtice as formerly you had in iniquity; Sobriety will reliſh better then drunkenneſs, you will diſcern more charms in Alms then in Robbery, and taſte a farre richer pleaſure in giving your own, then in taking that of your neighbour. Prayer will out-vie the Paſtimes of the Theatre; Pſalmes and Hymnes will entertain you better then amorous Sonnets, or the Aires of the Court: you will goe to Church more chearfully then ever you went to a Play, and reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the change of your heart, you will acknowledge Grace the cauſe thereof; and that the barren ground of your ſoul bare no fruits, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath been pleaſed to water it with the perfumes of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Influences: For 'tis an undoubted Maxime, that Good though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo excellent, begins not to be deſired, till it begin to be pleaſurable; Though it have more charms then beauty, more luſtre then glory, more invitations then profit: if it convey not pleaſure into the will, it knows not how to beget love; Pleaſure is the Load-ſtone that draws all hearts that are capable of love; 'tis the poyſon that diſtils into the heart of all ſinners, and the only anſwer they return thoſe that condemn them: They oppoſe nothing but pleaſure againſt all reproaches; and when truth it ſelf accuſeth them, they have but one reaſon wherewith to defend themſelves; they cannot forſooth leave that they take ſo much delight in. Indeed they would never ſin, did not pleaſure ſolicit them; nor would the Devil ever maſter their will, did he not make uſe of pleaſure to gain their conſent: He employs the ſame devices againſt them, he did againſt our firſt Father; he makes uſe of the fleſh to gain the ſpirit, as he dealt with the woman to ſeduce the man; he tries by ſuggeſtion to produce pleaſure in his heart, that pleaſure may quicken ſin: He knows that this Commander is too free to be compell'd, but he knows alſo that he is too amorous to hold out, if he call not in another to his aid whereby he may be defended.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is the way God deals with ſouls to gain them; he uſeth not his power, but his ſweetneſs; he employs not his threats, but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and when he intends to vanquiſh a creature, he makes not uſe of pain, but of pleaſure; he combates ſenſual delights with ſpiritual ones; he oppoſeth the charms of vertue againſt the allurements of ſin; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires thoughts ſo ſweet and ſo powerful, that they blot out all thoſe of the Earth: and knowing very well that the Will always complies with the more predominant delectation that ſolicits her; he is content to be lik't, that he may be victorious: For if Concupiſcence conteſt with Grace about the conqueſt of a heart, ſhe that promiſeth the higheſt pleaſure ſhall prevail; and though never ſo free, the <hi>Helen</hi> will be overcome by the temptation if it appear more agreeable then the Law of God. Therefore when Jeſus
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115672:102"/>Chriſt undertakes our Converſion, he infuſes into our ſouls innocent pleaſures, which are more prevalent then thoſe of ſin; he unmasks the beauties of vertue, he charms us with her allurements, and raviſheth our hearts by holy delights that make his Grace victorious.</p>
                  <p>Then is it that we reſiſt the temptations of Satan, that we contemn the revolts of the fleſh, and raiſed above our ſelves are amazed that ſuch weak enemies have been able heretofore to worſt us: Then is it that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs runne to the Faggot, that enchaunted with this pleaſure that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes their ſpirit, they triumph over Devils and Executioners, trample upon flames and wilde Beaſts, and turn the cruelty of tyrants into won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and admiration. Muſt not the pleaſure that charms them be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding powerfull, when they tumble upon hot burning coals as upon a bed of roſes? When they ſwallow down melted lead, as moſt delicious liquours? Receive wounds a favours? Prefer Priſons before Palaces, Gibbets before Thrones, and Crowns of Thorns before thoſe of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds? Is not this that victorious pleaſure that tranſports maids out of the dwellings of their parents, burying them alive in cloyſters, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their inclinations, obligeth them to quit gold and ſilk, to put on hair and ſackcloth? Is it not this innocent pleaſure that makes them neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the advantages of their birth, and perſwading them that vertue is the beauty of the ſoul, obliges them to deſpiſe the charming comelineſs of the face? Is it not finally this Grace as imperious as agreeable, that animates the Religious againſt themſelves, that arms their hands to revenge the Son of God, whom they have offended, and making a juſt indignation the parent of a holy love, obliges them to perſecute themſelves? Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude then from all this Diſcourſe, that Grace cannot force man, becauſe it is ſo ſweet; and that the moſt prevalent never deſtroys our liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its power conſiſts in gentleneſs; But withall let us confeſs, that ſhe is victorious in all her deſigns, that ſhe finds no reſiſtance in the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſinners, becauſe ſhe charms their wils by pleaſures, which ſeem the firſt fruits of thoſe they ſhall reap in glory, and which make the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable taſte one part of that felicity here, the bleſſed feed upon in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

                  <head>The Eighth DISCOURSE. <hi>That Effectuall Grace deſtroyes not Sufficient Grace.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IF it be a truth that Nature hath ſome ſecrets that cannot be diſcovered, that ſhe conceals her vertue when ſhe means to produce a wonder, and ſteals out of the ſight of her deareſt lovers, when ſhe deals in myſteries; we need not think it ſtrange that God the Authour of Nature reveals not his deſigns to all the world, and that there are ſome ſo profound, that his moſt intimate friends are not acquainted with. The Oeconomy of mans ſalvation is ſo involv'd, that all thoſe that goe about to explain it are in danger to miſtake; all foundations their reaſon relies upon in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are ſo infirm, that having well diſcourſed, they are obliged to confeſs their ignorance, and adore the wiſdome of God that hath reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the diſpoſall of his creatures. Neither indeed doe I pretend to examine his deſigns, nor to penetrate his intentions, but to ſearch out the meaning of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and to ſee in this Diſcourſe whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the order eſtabliſhed in the ſtate of Innocence to be ſo ruined, that there remained no footſtep of it in the world; and whether he judged Effectuall Grace ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that he held Grace ſufficient me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited by Jeſus Chriſt to be altogether uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Though the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> hath corrupted the Nature of man, though all men are born Delinquents, their inclinations irregular, and the faculties of their ſouls weakned; yet muſt we confeſs with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that this diſorder cannot deface the Characters God hath ſtampt upon his workmanſhip. Reaſon ſerves for a Law to Inſidels, and teacheth them what the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> taught the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> all her lights are not put out, and in the midſt of that darkneſs wherein infidelity hath plunged her,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nulla eſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma quamvis perverſa quae tamen ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nari poteſt in cujus conſcientia non loquatur Deus: quis enim legem naturale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcripſit in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus hominum niſi Deus?</hi> Aug.</note> ſhe retains ſome knowledge of her Creator; The paſſions that trouble her and the ſenſes that ſeduce her, cannot yet perſwade her that the body ought to be her Soveraign: neither is there any ſinner ſo brutiſh, but knows that of two parts that compoſe him, the nobleſt ought to be the moſt abſolute. Notwithſtanding all the injuſtice which ſwarms amongſt men, it cannot blot out of their ſouls this maxime, that Nature hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven there: <hi>What thou wouldſt not have done to thy ſelf, doe not to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and had neither Law-givers nor Philoſophers forbidden Murders &amp; Adulteries, there was a Judge within them had made an Edict againſt both theſe iniquities: So that we may ſay in their very infidelity they had the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115672:103"/>firſt Principles of Religion and Morality; and if they diſcerned not in God the Trinity of Perſons, they knew at leaſt the Unity of his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>If all theſe advantages be the reliques of Original righteouſneſs, and the ſplinters of that great ſhipwrack where Nature was wholly loſt in one man; If the ſeeds of vertues be the ſteps of the innocence in men, and if Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that puniſheth Criminals, be an expreſſion of Divine Juſtice, I am eaſily perſwaded to believe, that there remains ſome aſſiſtance for Infidels that ſollicites them to the practice of vertue, and gives them ſome thoughts of their ſalvation in the midſt of Paganiſme it ſelf.
<note place="margin">

Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acknoweldgeth their actions profitable to the Common-wealth, that their vertue though imperfect, carried luſtre with it, and though no way comparable to that of true believers, had notwithſtanding beauty enough to condemn one day bad Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But admit the vertue of Infidels be falſe, that hinders not but they may have ſome aſſiſtance from Heaven to diſcern good from evil, and to take from them that excuſe wherewith the pride of man ſhelters it ſelf having ſinned through ignorance. This was the motive that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced God to give the Law to the Jews,
<note place="margin">

This is it perhaps that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> means in the nineteenth Chapter of his third Book of <hi>Free-will,</hi> where he grants that God hath deprived no body of the meanes to ſeek after truth: and that the power of finding it is common to all men. If their mind may be enlightned with ſome heavenly light, their will may be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſome regret for their offences, they may have good thoughts and good motions which they reject; their being in Infidelity puts them
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115672:104"/>not yet in the ſtate of Reprobation: God makes ſome difference between theſe delinquents and the damned; he deals not with them as with the devils: and if it be true that he ſuſpends the torments of theſe, I can eaſily be perſwaded that he withholds the ſins of thoſe, and that they have graces that diſengage their Will for ſome moments from the tyranny of Concupiſcence. They act not always under the conduct of this enemy; and though they are his ſlaves, yet they have a Soveraign, who, never loſing his rights, can defend them when he pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the trueſt Interpreter, and moſt knowing diſciple of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> was of the ſame opinion, neither intended to diſſent from his Maſter: He judged right with him, that whatever is done among Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, and among Chriſtians, by the inſtigation of Concupiſcence, is ſin: but he did not believe that Mercy had utterly forſaken the Heathen, and that ſhe imparts no Grace unto them, which, though leaving them in errour, diſengageth them many times from ſin. If there be ſupernatural aſſiſtances that prepare us for Faith, and make us conceive ſome good thoughts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be made Believers, there may alſo be ſome, which, not drawing the Heathen out of their Infidelity, may preſerve them from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſome offences, and make them perform ſome actions which relate to the Supreme Good imperfectly known, and imperfectly loved.</p>
                  <p>When God heretofore converted the Heathen,

There is ſome Grace that is not abſolutely inconſiſtent with Infidelity, becauſe there is ſome love that is not altogether incompatible with ſin; and as every day ſinners feel ſupernatural motions that lift them up towards God, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to do good works, we may ſay alſo that Infidels receive ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſupply that rectifies their intentions,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>And certainly, they are not deſtitute of all Graces, becauſe S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> obſerves ſome in them, which he acknowledgeth not in the Jews: For, explaining that famous and difficult paſſage where Jeſus Chriſt aſſures us that thoſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> had certainly repented, had they ſeen the miracles he did in <hi>Judea;</hi> this great Doctor avows, that the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were not ſo blinde nor ſo hardned as the <hi>Jews;</hi> that they had one advantage, which holding from Nature and Grace, prepared them for Faith; <hi>A natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally-divine gift of underſtanding, whereby they are moved to Faith:</hi> that they had believed the miracles of the Son of God, had they had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to have ſeen them, <hi>Quoniam credidiſſent ſi qualia viderunt iſti, ſigna vidiſſent;</hi> and that this Grace had produced its effect, had the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115672:104"/>whereon it depended intervened: But though it gave them a power of being converted, 'twas as uſeleſs to them, as Chriſts miracles were to the Jews, becauſe neither of them were of the number of the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, <hi>Sed nec illis profuit quod credere poterant, quia praedeſtinati non erant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Doctor is not far from this opinion, when writing againſt <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> he ſaith to that Heretick, that they were more equitable then he, who aſcribed the vertues of the Heathen to the aſſiſtance of heaven, and not to their own Free-will; and who granted them ſome grace in their Infidelity, which they acknowledged after their converſion. Perhaps the impulſe of S. <hi>Dennis</hi> at the death of the Son of God, was of this kinde, That the Oracle he pronounced was inſpired into him from heaven, and that he felt the effects of the Croſs before he knew the vertue thereof. 'Tis to no purpoſe to object that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſlights this opinion, having judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not ſo bad as that of the <hi>Pelagians;</hi> and that he condemns it,
<note place="margin">Sed abſit ut ſit in aliquo vera virtus niſi fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit juſtus; abſit autem ut ſit ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus vere niſi vivat ex fide: juſtus enim ex. fide vivit.</note> when he proteſts that there is no ſolid vertue, where there is not a lively Faith, and true Juſtice: For, if we take thoſe words in the ſtricteſt acception, we muſt confeſs that ſinners whoſe Faith is dead, can do no good works; and that all thoſe that are not juſt, can practiſe no vertue: Sinners are as arrogant as Infidels; they contemn the humility of the Son, which they do not imitate; they are the ſlaves of the devil, whoſe motions they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and that remainder of Faith, that languiſheth in their ſoul, ſeems to ſerve onely to render them more culpable then the Heathen. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith that the vertue of theſe is not true, becauſe not quickned by Faith, he ſpeaks certainly of a perfect vertue agreeable to God, profitable to him that practifeth it, and which may merit eternal life for him. Now there is no man but ſees that the vertue of Heathens and Sinners hath not theſe conditions; and though it proceed from a good Principle, and reſpect a lawful End, may yet be ſtiled deficient, becauſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Maxime of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bonum ex inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra Cauſa, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum ex quolibet defectu.</hi> Ariſto.</note> an action is bad when it labours under any defect. After all this Argumentation, I cannot but confeſs that the graces of Infidels are very rare; and if they remain ſubject to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they will not deliver them from their errours: But they are more common among Chriſtians, and act more powerfully over their Wills, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there they finde leſs reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>This Propoſition is evident according to the principles of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> becauſe in a thouſand places of his Writings he will have Faith teach us to pray, and that Supplication obtain that ſuccour that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſubduing of Concupiſcence. I know very well that Prayer ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Grace, that a man muſt be inſtructed in the School of the holy Ghoſt, to ſpeak to the Eternal Father; but it ſeems this grace is offered to all the Faithful, ſerving us for a defence in our infirmity; and that as in all times our enemies may aſſault us, we may in all times alſo defend our: ſelves. For if the Grace of Prayer were not eaſie and common, it never
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115672:105"/>had been ordained of God for the obtaining of all others; and we ſhould have ſome reaſon to complain of him that hath obliged us to have recourſe to that <hi>Aſylum,</hi> if it were not more in out diſpoſal then thoſe things we intreat by means thereof. This remedy is as common as it is eaſie; 'tis a favour which God refuſeth not but to ſome notorious offenders: a man muſt often have rejected it, to be deprived of its aſſiſtance; and it ſeems that the ſoul that is inanimated with habitual Grace, hath ſome right and power to flee to Prayer, when dejected with ſorrow, or aſſaulted by temptation.</p>
                  <p>The hardening of Sinners is another proof of the Truth I endeavour to promote: For ſince, according to the doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> this puniſhment is nothing elſe but the withdrawing of Grace,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obdurat Deus non imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo gratiam; quibus enim non impertitur, nec digni ſunt, nec merentur.</hi> Aug.</note> we muſt needs confeſs that thoſe who are not yet hardned, have ſome grace gently bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on to piety, which ſollicites their conſent, and, not uſing an abſolute power, as effectual Grace doth, ſeparates them withal from thoſe God hath utterly given over, and from thoſe God conducts to heaven by more ſure ways, and more powerful motions.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> preaching to his people, and letting them ſee the great danger in deſpiſing thoſe good inſpirations that come from heaven, ſaid, that ſinners ſometimes could not be converted, though they had a will to it, becauſe they would not do it when they had the power. <hi>Impius,</hi> ſaith this great Doctor, <hi>dum vult non poteſt, quia dum potuit noluit.</hi> I know ſome Divines take that wicked one for <hi>Adam,</hi> who making no uſe of his grace whereby he had power to act, loſt it for himſelf and for all his poſterity; and ſay that 'tis he S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of in that paſſage: But whoever ſhall take good notice of his intention, will clearly perceive that he aſcends not ſo high as Paradiſe, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains not of the firſt man onely, but of all his children, who neglect the power they have to do good, and juſtly are deprived of it, for not having made uſe thereof. Otherwiſe ſinners would lay all their faults upon the perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> and eſteeming themſelves more unfortunate then ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would blame S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for accuſing them to have abuſed a power they never had.</p>
                  <p>But nothing better confirms ſufficient grace, then our refuſing to obey it. Experience teacheth us, there are Divine ſweetneſſes which are not always victorious: Grace triumphs not continually, when it combats ſin: S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> often found that his ill habits were more prevalent then the invitations of Grace; and that his Will, like a Needle between two Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones, quitted the more feeble and innocent pleaſure, to cloſe with the ſtronger and more criminal: Had Grace been effectual, ſhe had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this ſhameful repulſe; her firſt attempts had gained this ſinner; and S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> after he had taſted the innocent delights of holy love, would not have longed to drink of the muddy waters of Voluptuouſneſs. But were all their deſignes of Grace followed with their effects, did this Conquereſs
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115672:105"/>of Hearts fight no battels that were not accompanied with victories; the Saints, whoſe confeſſions are as true as they are humble, would never accuſe themſelves for reſiſting her motions, and being untrue to her inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For they complain not onely of this habitual oppoſition which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loſt till they are received into glory, and which ſtill ſubſiſts in us, even then when Grace hath gotten the maſtery; but they complain of an actual oppoſition which cannot agree with effectual Grace: they acknowledge their reſiſting the holy Ghoſt, that their ſoul, poſſeſt with ſelf-love, diſputes with the love of God, and, reſenting their weakneſs, conjure heaven to redouble its batteries, and to make uſe of ſome more powerful grace, to bring their rebellious Wills in ſubjection.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> nor his Interpreters diſſent from this opinion: for they confeſs that there are ineffectual Graces which produce indeed ſome effect in the ſinner, but convert him not, and cannot be rightly ſtiled victorious, becauſe they ſurmount not unlawful and criminal pleaſure, which corrupt the Will; ſo that we may ſay, This Grace hath not done all that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do, ſince fighting againſt her enemy, ſhe was not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him: For though it be uſually anſwered, that this Grace is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, becauſe it always produceth its effect, and that it is felt by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in whoſe ſoul ſhe begets a pleaſure that tickles him; but is not fully prevalent, becauſe ſhe cannot perfect his converſion, nor diſengage him from ſin. Me thinks a man may reply, from the principles of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that this Grace is not efficacious, becauſe not victorious; that ſhe rights and is beaten; that ſhe carries not the advantage thorowout, which ſhe pretended over her enemy; and that we cannot imagine that having ſet upon him, her deſigne was not to ſubdue him. 'Tis eaſie alſo to prove that this Grace is ſufficient, becauſe it makes war upon ſin, endeavours his expulſion, and would certainly be accounted raſh or indiſcreet, had ſhe undertaken a deſigne beyond her power: Moreover, every one knows, that if the ſinner had not fortified Concupiſcence by his bad habits, this Grace had been able to convert him, and by its innocent pleaſure outvie that criminal ſenſuality he findes in his iniquity, becauſe he hath a minde to take up his dwelling in it.</p>
                  <p>To all this I adde the teſtimony of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> which ought to be ſo much the leſs ſuſpected, becauſe taken from two places where he ſeems more ſtrongly to eſtabliſh the neceſſity of effectual Grace: For all the world confeſſeth that this great Doctor never expreſſed himſelf more clearly then in the Eleventh Chapter of his Book of Correction and of Grace: There it is that he diſtinguiſheth the grace of <hi>Adam</hi> from that of Jeſus Chriſt, that he calls the firſt a grace of Poſſibility, and the other a grace of effect: 'Tis there that he teacheth that the former was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for man an innocent; that the ſecond is neceſſary for man a ſinner; and that in the diſorders and infirmities he daily experienceth, it would be impoſſible for him to continue any long time victorious, if he had not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115672:106"/>ſome more powerfull aſſiſtance then that of <hi>Adam.</hi> In the mean time, when he ſpeaks of the Grace of Poſſibility, he profeſſeth that it is not loſt with Innocence, that there remains one like it merited by Jeſus Chriſt; that if God refuſe it to ſome, 'tis out of juſtice; if he beſtow it upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 'tis from his Goodneſs; and if it were in ſome ſort due to Innocent man, 'tis not at all due to man a Criminall; becauſe that Grace which was indulg'd the juſt in the Paradiſe of <hi>Eden,</hi> is not now given to ſinners in the Paradiſe of the Church. He ſaith the ſame thing in the twenty ſixt Chapter of the Book of Nature and Grace:
<note place="margin">

                           </gap>us.</hi> Aug.</note> For comparing the ſinner with a man ſick, a juſtified perſon with one that is whole, he determines that the former hath need of Grace that may cure him, the ſecond of grace that may ſupport him; and as the ſoundeſt eye cannot ſee unleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by light, the juſteſt man cannot live if he be not aſſiſted by Grace. This Compariſon makes thoſe that are acquainted with the Principles of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> judge that man perfectly juſtified ſtands not in need of a ſtronger Grace then man an innocent; becauſe, his Will being fully poſſeſt by Charity, 'tis enough that he be endued with aſſiſtance that ſupports him, without any more powerful one to tranſport and maſter him.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of this anſwer, we muſt remember that Grace in the ſtate of Innocence upheld man, becauſe he was weak; and in the ſtate of ſin cured him, becauſe he was diſeaſed. For as the Eye when ſound, needs nothing but light to ſee: but when ſore, wants ſome <hi>Collyrium</hi> to heal it, and prepare it for ſight; So Innocent man needed but one Grace to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten him, but ſinful man needs a Grace that may cure him. Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſuppoſing this compariſon ſaith, that Grace cures a ſick man, when it converts a ſinner: that being an Eye-ſalve and a Light, 'tis withall a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and a remedy; But he addes, when the ſinner is made whole and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſtified, he hath no more need, as the Eye that is ſound, but of one Grace, which having more of Light then of <hi>Collyrium,</hi> preſerves him in the ſtate he is entred into by his Converſion, and treats him more like an Innocent then a Criminall.</p>
                  <p>Fairly to reconcile the two parties that conteſt about this ſubject, let us ſay that one and the ſame Grace may bear two different names: That 'tis ſufficient, becauſe the will may reſiſt it; neither doth it always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects in man a ſinner, as in man an Innocent: Let us ſay thai 'tis Effectuall, becauſe never unprofitable, always prevailing by ſome advantage over our liberty, that it not only clears the underſtanding, but warms the heart; and being not in vain, as that Sufficient Grace which never doth nothing, nor Omnipotent, neither as that Effecutall Grace that always does what it will: 'tis of a middle temper between both, and may juſtly bear the name of Sufficient and Effectuall. We muſt never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs acknowledge, that this laſt begins and ends the work of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it diſengageth our ſoul from the ſlavery of Satan, breaks the fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of thoſe that lie under the tyranny of ſin, raiſeth up the juſt, when they

                  <p>INnocence and Truth have this misfortune, that they are often aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but they have this advantage, they ſtill return victorious: The former triumphs over Calumny, the ſecond over Falſhood; The former owes a piece of her beauty to ſlanderers that would oppreſs her; The later owes much of her luſtre to Hereticks that would obſcure her. This Maxime is clearly ſeen in the buſineſs of Grace, which never ſeems more tranſparent then by doubts, nor better eſtabliſhed then by difficulties that oppoſe it. Indeed all the Objections that have been made againſt her power, have ſerved only to ſupport her: and as all her combats have been the midwives of her victories, all the writings of her adverſaries have ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her ſo many Trophies. Therefore I ſhould ſtain her glory, did I not rehearſe the principal reaſons humane Philoſophy hath made uſe of to deſtroy her: that their weakneſs may heighten her force, and the vanity of their attempts occaſion one part of her triumph.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrongeſt Engine hath been planted againſt her, is the Intereſt of Liberty, which it ſeems cannot be preſerved with the Neceſſity attributed to Grace: For if ſhe be the miſtreſs of the Will, if ſhe always gain her conſent, if ſhe take away her indifferency, and ſuffer her not to follow her bad inclinations; How can ſhe be free in this Neceſſity.

Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Voluntary with Free, and believe that whatever we do voluntarily we do freely, though otherwiſe we be in ſome ſort neceſſitated to do it. Theſe certainly are not perſwaded that Indifferency is eſſential to Liberty; but on the contrary, they imagine that as Neceſſity is a mark of a Will fixed and determined, Indifferency is the argument of a Will doubtful and unreſolved. <hi>Seneca,</hi> who was as jealous of his Liberty as any other Philoſopher, was of opinion that Man was never more free in Good, then when he was ſo ſtrongly faſtned to it, that nothing could ſeparate him. Wee ſhall better conceive of his meaning, if we well apprehend the difficulty he would reſolve. He propounds an Objection which hath much
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115672:107"/>reſemblance with thoſe which are ſtarted againſt Grace; and demands if the Stars, which he ſuppoſed inanimated, could oblige us by their Light and Influence, becauſe, being neceſſitated to give us both, it ſeems they could do no otherwiſe, and therefore we were not beholding to them. See the Anſwer he returns to theſe Philoſophers: 'Tis a great argument of a firm Will, not to be able to change; and we are not to imagine that a man will not a thing, when he wills it ſo ſtrongly that 'tis not in his power not to will it at all: For who is ſo unadviſed as to deny that the Wil is free, when ſhe is no longer in danger to quit her reſolution to embrace a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary! nay, who ought not rather to judge that ſhe is never ſo free, as when her reſolution is ſo firm, that it becomes eternal? Indeed, if we believe he wills a thing who may not will it: Muſt we not believe that he wills it much more, when he wills it ſo powerfully, that he is paſt all danger of not willing it?</p>
                  <p>But he could not better reſolve this Doubt, then when oppoſing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint againſt Neceſſity, he ſaith, The later may be found with Liberty; and if we have no obligation to a man that does us a courteſie becauſe he was forced to it, we have notwithſtanding to him that does it becauſe he cannot do otherwiſe, and hath impoſed this neceſſity upon himſelf, with which he cannot poſſibly diſpenſe. This opinion hath its Reaſons to back it; and, though it ſeem ſomewhat ſingular, hath notwithſtanding Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers for its Protectors, whoſe judgement 'tis that the Will is never more free then when 'tis leſs indifferent: For if Liberty, ſay they, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a fixation of the Will, we muſt acknowledge that ſhe is never more free then when, by many indifferent acts, ſhe is ſo united to her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that ſhe cannot poſſibly undo her ſelf. Otherwiſe perfect Love would deprive us of Liberty; the uſe of that power would deſtroy it; and it would follow, that to have a long time acted freely, we ſhould ceaſe to be free. They confeſs that Indifferency, which they look upon as a weakneſs of Liberty, is leſſened by the power of Love; and the more ſtrongly a man affects a thing, the leſs indifferencie hath he to quit it. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you ſhall never perſwade a Lover that the loſs of his Indifferency is the loſs of his Liberty; that the more his Paſſion increaſeth, the more his worth diminiſheth; and, for being more conſtant, he is leſs acceptable to her he loveth.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome Divines of the opinion of theſe Philoſophers; who, finding no Indifferency in Jeſus Chriſt, nor in the Bleſſed, cannot imagine it inſeparable from Liberty. For Jeſus Chriſt was free, becauſe he merited the reconciliation of men with his Father; he was free, becauſe he ſatisfied for their ſins; and all the hope of their ſalvation is founded as well upon the Liberty as upon the Dignity of his actions:

Finally, they cannot be perſwaded that the Saints have loſt their Liberty in the enjoyment of Glory; for having loſt their Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: They cannot believe that the Bleſſed are ſlaves, that their love is not free becauſe neceſſary, and that the firmneſs of their condition cancels the perfection of their Liberty. They adde further, that no man ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that Grace, which is Glory begun, deprives us of Liberty, when it deprives us of Indifferency; not that it reduceth us to the condition of Slaves, becauſe it brings us neer to that of the Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>But as all agree not upon the ſame Principles; Other Divines, leaning upon Reaſon and Scripture, will have Indifference inſeparable from Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this world; that men may always will Good and Evil, and that they are never ſo ſtrongly determined to the one, but they may quit it to embrace the other. They judge that Grace does not ſo fix the Will upon Good, that it takes away her Indifferency, but that there remains ſome inclination or ſome capacity towards Evil; ſo that even when ſhe is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Grace, ſhe hath ſtill in the centre of her Being a certain Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, making her capable to change her minde, and to depart from the Supreme Good that poſſeſſeth her. According to this Principle, we muſt ſay, that as Grace, tranſporting us, leaves us a power to reſiſt; ſo alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining us, an Indifferency; That as we may hold out, ſo may we change if we will; and conſequently, there is no moment wherein our Will is not always Indifferent.</p>

This domeſtick ſedition makes them long for Glory which hath this advantage over Grace that, deſtroying all the remainders of ſin, and confirming their will in Good, it lifts them to a condition which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them no longer to contradict the pleaſures of the Almighty. But in expectation of this happie hour, they confeſs, with as much confuſion of face as grief of heart, that though they will not reſiſt him that draws them, they can nevertheleſs do it; becauſe Grace hath not ſo ſtrongly root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in good, but they may forſake it, ſhould the mercy of God give them over to their own infirmity.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:115672:108"/>
                  <p>'Tis then eaſie enough to comprehend, that Grace, though effectual, takes not away from the greateſt Saints the power to reſiſt Jeſus Chriſt: But 'tis very hard to conceive how their complaints are true, and how they can with reaſon accuſe themſelves for having been unfaithful to him: For the accuſations of Saints ought to be ſincere; humility muſt not make them renounce Truth, nor, to avoid Pride, engage in a Lye: Theſe are two extremes equally dangerous, which all thoſe that are led by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ought carefully to avoid. In the mean time, they accuſe themſelves daily before Men and Angels, that they reſiſt Grace, that they abuſe his favours, and fruſtrate his deſignes: This ſin is conſtantly the firſt Article of their Confeſſion; they look upon it as the ſource of all the reſt; and theſe great men, that are better acquainted with the motions of Grace then the learnedſt Divines, never ſpeak thereof without regret for having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them.</p>
                  <p>I profeſs this Objection ſeems one of the ſtrongeſt can be formed againſt Effectual Grace, becauſe I have taken it for a proof of Grace Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; and withal, it ſeems to claſh againſt the Principles of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine:</hi> for if Grace always produceth her effect, how can we reſiſt it? if ſhe make her ſelf miſtreſs of our Will, how can ſhe meet with rebellion there? and if ſhe manage that faculty with as much force as dexterity, how can we oppoſe her deſigns, or ſtop the conqueſts of her that S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſo many times calls victorious? I know ſome Doctors diſpatch this difficulty by an Anſwer that admits of no Reply, and ſay, that when the Saints complain of their infidelity towards Grace, their meaning is to ſpeak of that which toucheth our Senſes, or enlightens our Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and being ſo well inſtructed in the School of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> they are not ignorant that the true Grace of Jeſus Chriſt infallibly produceth its effect. But this Anſwer never ſatisfied me; and I muſt acknowledge the language of the Saints ſeems too ſtrong to be expreſſed by ſo weak a grace. They ſpeak of their reſiſtance with ſo much grief, that we may judge by their complaints, that 'tis of the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, which they have abuſed, that they intend to ſpeak. Some others believe 'tis not an actual reſiſtance that they accuſe themſelves of, becauſe that is incompatible with effectual grace; but of an habitual reſiſtance that combats the deſigne of Grace, though it hinders not its effect. Theſe ſeem better grounded then the former, becauſe 'tis true that the greateſt Saint in the world hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways an oppoſition againſt Grace, as long as there is one degree of ſelf-love; and is contrary to Jeſus Chriſt, as long as he is conformable in any thing to the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> The inordinate intentions which inſenſibly faſten him to the things of the world, the revolt of the Paſſions that trouble the repoſe of his minde, and Concupiſcence that weakens Charity, are ſo many enemies heaving at Grace, and retarding the accompliſhment of her deſignes: But for all this we muſt confeſs that this Anſwer reſolves not fully the whole difficulty of the Objection: for beſides that this reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115672:108"/>to ſpeak properly, is not a ſin, becauſe 'tis purely habitual, nor ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Saints more culpable then Concupiſcence; we know very well that it impedes not the effect of Grace; and that when God intends to make himſelf maſter of the Will, he can as well tame bad Habits as bad In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
                  <p>Therefore have I thought it neceſſary to adde, That there are ſecret oppoſitions againſt Grace, that are unknown to us; That the Will is not ſo fully poſſeſt by Charity, but Concupiſcence ſhares with her; That there is no inconvenience that ſhe ſhould be inanimated at the ſame time with two contrary loves, though one be victorious over the other; ſeeing S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> hath ſo often confeſſed, that his heart being divided between two affections, he willed at the ſame time two things utterly oppoſite. Or we muſt ſay that Grace, though efficacious in the beginning, languiſheth in the progreſs; that when the motion that carried the Will grows weak, Concupiſcence awakes, and attempts a victory when ſhe findes leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Thus Grace is worſted in her retreat; ſelf-love takes courage when the love of God gives ground; and this Grace that was victorious in the onſet, becomes, as all things in the world, faint and drooping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end. If this Anſwer croſſeth the principles of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I diſavow it; and if it reſolve not the difficulty propounded, I intreat thoſe that ſhall read this Work to conſider, that Grace is not leſs wonderſul then Nature; and if the vertue of the Loadſtone hath left ſo many Philoſophers at a loſs, we need not wonder if the power of Grace put the Divines in a confuſion.</p>

There is nothing more certain in Chriſtianity, then that Grace is the Principle of our Salvation; that ſhe ſupports our Will, and gives that faculty ſtrength to ſtand out againſt Concupiſcence. In the mean time, this Truth is the mother of Errours;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115672:109"/>our underſtanding hath drawn more darkneſs thence then light, and the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that hath ruined the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> hath produced more ſcruples then reſolutions amongſt Divines: We cannot ſpeak of the dominion of Grace, but we are troubled to ſecure the liberty of man; We are well content God ſhould be the Maſter, becauſe we dare not diſpute his Soveraignty;

The Objections that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> are proofs of this paſſion, and the number is ſo great, that one Diſcourſe being not large enough to reſolve them, we muſt employ this ſupplement to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>One of the ſtrongeſt and moſt remarkable, is, that Baptiſme is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Birth, where the Chriſtian being regenerated, ſeems to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a new Nature. For in that happy moment wherein his ſins are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he receives Habitual Grace, which uniting him to Jeſus Chriſt as to his Head, ſets him free from the ſlavery of Satan, and entitles him to the felicity of Angels. Foraſmuch as this Grace is a ſecond nature, ſhe hath her faculties whereby ſhe works: Faith is her Light, Hope her Strength, Charity her Love, and theſe three vertues are ſupernatural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits that elevate her underſtanding and her will. As God refuſeth not his aſſiſtance to his creature to act with, pleads no diſpenſation for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thoſe Laws he hath preſcribed; nay, is helpfull to his very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that he may not be wanting to his Word; It ſeems that in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Grace, he owes the ſame faithfulneſs to Chriſtians, that he is bound to aſſiſt them in all their actions: and out of an obligation that no way injures his Greatneſs, becauſe worthy his Goodneſs he ought in ſome ſort to concur with the faithful in all their operations;

                  <p>To back our Anſwer, we muſt ſuppoſe that the order of Nature, and that of Grace, are very different: in the firſt order God ſeems to be in ſome ſort reſponſible to his creature; he never diſpenſeth with himſelfe but by miracle: when he refuſeth his aid to a ſinner, makes the hand
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115672:109"/>wither that is about to commit a Parricide, or ties the tongue that was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to utter a blaſphemy; every one looks upon theſe effects as Prodigies: But he owes nothing to his creature in the ſecond order; he entred not into it but by Grace, nor doth he perſevere in it, but by Mercy; In rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to this ſtate, he is not tied to any rules: what he hath once gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, obliges him not to continue; and when he receives a ſinner into his Church, 'tis with conditions, which no ways prejudice his Soveraignty.

                  <p>This Anſwer is taken out of the pure Doctrine of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 'tis founded upon his principles, and he that makes a difficulty to receive it, will not be a Diſciple of that great Maſter: But becauſe it ſeems too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to thoſe that are not inſtructed in his School, who conſider not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently the abſolute power Divine Juſtice hath reſerv'd to it ſelf over the reprobate, let us adde here this temperament, and ſay, that Chriſtians have ſome right to Grace whilſt they are united to Jeſus Chriſt, and that they may obtain it by Prayer, when they find too much difficulty in good, or too much engagement in evil.</p>
                  <p>But this Anſwer ſtarts a new Objection, and ſeems to combat the power of Grace in labouring to eſtabliſh the facility of Prayer; For if by the mediation of this vertue we can obtain every thing, our ſalvation is in our own hands, and we may purchaſe Grace by Supplication. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this Objection grounded not only upon the Principles of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> but even upon the Principles of Religion it ſelf. For Scripture exhorts all ſinners to prayer, propoſeth it to us as a help in all our needs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Petite &amp; da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur vobis, quae. rite &amp; invenie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pulſate &amp; aperietur vobis.</hi> Mat. 7.</note> and as a remedy for all our evils; it ſeems 'tis enough to be a believer to be able to pray, and that the Son of God having taught us the Lords Prayer, hath furniſhed us with arms for our defence againſt the juſtice of his Father. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> following the ſteps of Jeſus Chriſt, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in a thouſand places of his writings, that the Law diſcovers vertue to us, and Prayer obtains it; that 'tis the guard of Chriſtians, ſurmounting all temptations, ſweetning all difficulties, and triumphing over Devils. If then we are able to pray, we are able to perſevere; if what is not due to our merits be granted to our prayers, we may thereby obtain the Grace
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115672:110"/>that is the Beginning and the End of our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs this Objection puzzles me, nor does the ordinary Anſwer made to it at all ſatisfie me: For though Grace be requiſite to pray, though it is the Holy Spirit that puts the thoughts into our ſoul, the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions into our heart, and words into our mouthes; though a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that is not warm'd with his heats, is not acceptable to the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we muſt nevertheleſſe confeſs, either that Grace to pray is always offered to ns, or that we have no means to make our addreſſes to God in our needs. Therefore is it that Holy Scripture invites us every where to prayer. The Son of God tels us that it offers a pleaſing violence, that it changeth his will, ſweetens his ſeveritie, and obtains all Graces it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of him.

Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is of the ſame judgement, when explaining that paſſage he ſaith in expreſs tearms, that to ſecure us from vanity which may perſwade us that our prayer precedes Grace, it is ranked by the Apoſtle among the gifts of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>In this perplexity I can ſay nothing elſe, but that the Grace of Prayer is more common then other graces; that 'tis frequently offered to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; that God refuſeth it none but thoſe that undervalue it; that 'tis the principal cauſe of our Converſion, and that if by this unhappy power which remains in us, we reſiſt not the Holy Ghoſt, it would ſerve us for a ſtrong means to obtain of God all other favours. I perceive very well this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer rather ſcatters the difficulty then reſolves it: But who knows not that in all Sciences there are ſome Objections that cannot be anſwered, and in that of Salvation, which is the profoundeſt and moſt hidden, there are a thouſand, which cannot be avoided, but by the ſimplicity of faith. 'Tis enough to know in this, that Prayer is a Grace more eaſily obtained then others, and that if it be effectuall in reſpect of its effect, 'tis ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by reaſon of its facility.</p>
                  <p>But ſcarce are we delivered from one gulf, but we are ready to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another; and provide new Arms to defend us from a new aſſault, which is ſo much the harder to ſuſtain in that it takes all the force from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Saint <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> For this famous man that ſo diſcreetly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the juſtice of God with his mercy, teacheth us in a hundred places of his writings, that God never forſakes the ſinner till the ſinner forſakes him; that he is not of the humour of thoſe unfaithful friends, who loving our fortune better then our perſon, leave us when we have moſt need: He muſt be provoked to puniſh us, and out of an exceſſe of bounty, as he is always the firſt to prevent us, ſo is he the laſt to deſert us. All the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115672:110"/>of Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> rowls upon this Maxime;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si omnes pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catores Deus ſperneret, omnes utique ſperneret, quia ſine pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nemo eſt; ſed ſpernit diſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes à ſe quos Apoſtatas vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat</hi> Aug. de Nat. &amp; gra. cap. 62.</note> We muſt ruine his whole works to deſtroy it, and convince him of falſhood to convince him of change: He never retracted this Principle, and whenever he ſpeaks of the deſertion of a ſinner, healways lays the blame upon his own infidelity. But if Grace be effectual, if it abſolutely diſpoſe of mans wil; if Jeſus Chriſt neceſſarily apply it to vertue, how can ſhe abandon him, being in his hands, and he is rather the principle of her motions then her ſelf? For ſhe acts by power derived from him, obeys his orders, and as long as Grace hath her in poſſeſſion, hath no other deſire then to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly united to him.</p>
                  <p>The moſt uſuall Anſwer, and perhaps the ſoundeſt, is, that God never forſakes the ſoul of ſinners where he makes his reſidence, till they drive him away by ſome mortal ſin: and though he deny them Actual Grace, becauſe he is the maſter of it, and owes it no body; hee never deprives them of Habitual Grace, whereby he remains in their ſoul, till they have broken his Laws or profaned his Sacraments. The Diſciples of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> will be ſatisfied with this Anſwer; but I conceive it contents not others, who will reply with much reaſon, that God takes away Habituall grace from ſinners when he refuſeth them actuall Grace, becauſe they cannot preſerve one without the other; and ſo 'tis God always, who, contrary to the Maxime of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> quits the ſinner firſt. For every one confeſſeth, that as Habitual grace hath no other enemy that can deſtroy it, but mortal ſin, neither hath ſhe any other defence but Actual grace; and aſſoon as men are deprived of the aſſiſtance of the one, they are not only in danger, but in a neceſſity of loſing the other.</p>
                  <p>To ſtand ſo ſtrong an Objection, we muſt freely confeſs that there is ſome ſecret infidelity on the ſinners part unknown to us; that they make not all the uſe of the grace that is in their power, that ſome way or other they reſiſt its motions, and expoſe themſelves to dangers they might eaſily avoid: or elſe we muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge that God abandons them not for having refuſed them Effectuall Grace, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times by ſome other leſſe powerfull aſſiſtance, but ſufficient however, he ſcatters the occaſions that might engage them in ſin, weakens the force of temptations, rebuketh the inſolence of Satan, and deals with them ſtill as Friends, though not as Elect. Finally, we may boldly ſay, that there is not a juſt man but wanders from God every day: for he ſwerves as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he acts by the inſtigation of Concupiſcence; this wretched weight bends him towards the creature, and his weakneſs inſenſibly engages him in ſin: ſo that we need not wonder if God, ſeeing ſo many things in him contrary to his Grace, he deny him the aſſiſtance thereof, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons a ſinner that never loves him but when he is obliged to it by ſome forain external affection.</p>

                  <head>The Tenth DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Chriſtian findes more reſt in placing his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Grace, then in his Liberty.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere is no man in the world who is not as ſollicitous after his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as after his Pleaſure, and would not ſecure his Felicity as well as his Fortune: Sinners ſeek Good under the ſhadow of Evil; and theſe poor mad-men believe they approach their happineſs, even then when they turn their backs upon it. Our firſt father intended not to make himſelf miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by his diſobedience; he hoped to finde Immortality in that Fruit that was his Death; and he fancied repoſe and quietneſs in committing the ſin that occaſioned all his ſad calamities. His children are not wiſer then he; the ſame devil that deceived him, abuſeth them; and his impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident off-ſpring finde every day their torment, where they ſearch for their contentment. The Ambitious are remarkable witneſſes of this important verity; the Paſſion that animates them to theſe glorious enter priſes, where honour cannot be purchaſed without the hazard of their life, is both the Tyrant that poſſeſſeth them, and the Executioner that torments them: They ſeek, blinde as they are, reputation in Arms, and meet many times nothing but death: They feel themſelves Men, by thoſe very attempts they would paſs for Gods. Providence, that thwarts their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, makes them acknowledge that the proweſs of Conquerors holds as well of his Empire, as the prudence of Politicians.</p>
                  <p>But not to imbark into the deduction of a Truth whereof all ſinners can furniſh me with teſtimonies, 'tis enough to affirm that there are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians themſelves involved in this Error, who ſeek for reſt where they find nothing but vexation and diſcontent: For, to aſſure their ſalvation, they would have Predeſtination grounded upon their Merits; that God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their good works, when he ſeparated the Elect from the Reprobate; and foreſaw their Fidelity, when he deſtined them to Glory. They will have all Graces ſufficient; that their effects depend upon our Wills; that we be the authors of our Fortune; and that God preſenting us aids at every moment, 'tis in our power to entertain or reject them. They ſay Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt died indifferently for all men; that his merits are offered to us; that we can apply the vertue of them to our ſelves; and that in the midſt of Paganiſm, without Goſpel or Inſtruction, we may feel their effects. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, they will have Paradiſe ſtand open for all the world; that, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaying of our Saviour, ill interpreted, it may be carried by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and, without paſſing thorow the Church, a man may ſcale heaven.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115672:111"/>The deſire of their Salvation, is the ſource of theſe unjuſt deſires; They chuſe not this ſide, nor embrace this opinion, but becauſe they believe it favours their hopes: Vanity is mixt with Intereſt: being the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> they imitate the pride of their Father; they are guilty of his crime before they are aware; nor do they conſider that whilſt they go about to ſubject Grace to their Liberty, they follow his ſteps who had a minde to be god for no other end, but that he might live an Independent in reſpect of his Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>But were they far enough from the vain oftentation of their firſt father, they would certainly fall into his misfortune, whilſt they think to avoid it. For all Theologie aſſures us that Men and Angels were loſt, becauſe their Grace, being ſubjected to their Liberty, made them not conſtant in good: they made ill uſe of their advantage, becauſe they were maſters of it; nor did they fall into ſin, but becauſe their ſalvation was put into their own hands. Their Fall teacheth us, that we can have no weaker ſupport then our ſelves; that the Grace which relies onely upon our own Will, is very frail; and that ſinners that ground their hope upon the certainty of their reſolution, are very blinde, or very proud.</p>
                  <p>The Angels were much more illuminated then we; their light was much purer then ours; their ſtrength was not mixt with weakneſs: Theſe pure ſpirits were not embodied in fleſh and blood; and Nature being happily united with Grace in their perſon, baniſhed all diſorders that are in the creature by reaſon of ſin. In the mean time, all theſe advantages hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not from falling: the firſt temptation ſhook their Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not ſubmitted to Grace. The beauty of <hi>Lucifer</hi> dazled them, and ſtruck them in love: his promiſes made them forget thoſe of God; and the hope they fancied of raigning with that proud Angel, made them ſide with him in his rebellion. All theſe misfortunes have no other Cauſe but the weakneſs of Liberty; and he that ſhould ask theſe wretched ſpirits in the midſt of their torments, would receive no other anſwer, but that their Grace was unprofitable, becauſe it depended upon their Will.</p>
                  <p>Neither are you to object that the faithful Angels were ſaved by the ſame ſuccour the other neglected, becauſe all Divines are not agreed; and 'tis diſputed in the Schools, of the aſſiſtance they received to oppoſe the rebellion of <hi>Lucifer.</hi> The greateſt part of the Fathers were of opinion that the myſtery of the Incarnation was revealed to them at that inſtant; that they drew force from Jeſus Chriſt; that they fought under his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; that they overcame by the blood of the Lamb; and that they owe their triumphs to the Sacrifice of his death. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; and though, according to his Principles,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si utrique boni squaliter creati ſunt, iſtis mala voluntate cadentibus, illi amplius adjuti ad eam beatitudinis plenitudinem unde ſe nunqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> caſuros certiſſimi fierent, pervenerunt.</hi> Aug. l. 12. de Civ. Dei. c. 9.</note> it ſeems we muſt conclude that the good Angels were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſed but becauſe their Will made good uſe of their Grace, he unſays it in other places, and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ingenuouſly, that they received new aſſiſtances, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115672:112"/>that they were victorious, becauſe they were better ſeconded then the others. I know what may be ſaid in anſwer to this paſſage: but I finde it ſo clear, and uttered in ſuch ſtrong expreſſions, that thoſe that explain it will pardon me if I remain in my opinion, and if with S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> I believe that the good Angels owe not their ſalvation to Grace Sufficient, but to that Chriſtian Grace the Word Incarnate merited for them by his travels.</p>
                  <p>Though Man was not advantaged equal to the Angels, neither in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture nor in Grace, becauſe they were Hierarchies, and one was the rule of the other: yet every one confeſſeth Mans Will was created right; his Underſtanding cleared, his Senſes faithful, and his Paſſions obedient: He felt not thoſe revolts which now trouble our reſt; the Fleſh warred not againſt the Spirit; and thoſe two parts, notwithſtanding their difference, were not as yet enemies: original righteouſneſs compoſed their quarrels; and living in good intelligence under the dominion of this prerogative, they conſpired together mans felicity: Sufficient Grace was always offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; whatever enterpriſe he took in hand, this faithful companion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver left him; ſhe came to his aid as often as he called upon her; or rather, preventing his deſires and his neceſſities, waited his orders and directions. Nevertheleſs, amidſt all theſe priviledges, miſerable man loſt himſelf; the firſt temptation made him forget his duty; though he knew that his Soul was taken out of Nothing, and his body formed of the ſlime of the earth, he ſuffered himſelf to be perſwaded that in violating the Laws of God, he could make himſelf immortal. Whence, think you, proceeded this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune? and what was the cauſe of ſo diſmal a diſgrace? 'Twas not the ſtrength of the temptation; for that was ridiculous; and we cannot yet conceive how it could make any impreſſion upon the minde of a Rational creature: 'Twas not Concupiſcence; for this infamous daughter was not born before her Father, nor had Sin as yet given her a Being: 'Twas not the refuſal of Grace; for it was due to man in this ſtate, or at leaſt was never denied him. 'Twas then his Liberty which was the cauſe of his misfortune: his Will, which, without being forced by temptation, corrupted by the Senſes, or ſollicited by the Paſſions, made no uſe of Grace, and ſo fell headlong into ſin.</p>
                  <p>If it be true that Free-will was ſo impotent in the ſtate of Innocence, What can we expect in the ſtate of ſin? And if Sufficient Grace ſupported by original righteouſneſs, hindered not Man from falling, What aſſiſtance can we promiſe our ſelves thence, now that it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by Concupiſcence? Let us reſt our Salvation upon a ſurer Foundation; let us implore ſome more vigorous Grace; let us give our Liberty leave to be over-born by its motions; let us grow wiſe by our Fathers loſſes, and not pitch our hope upon a ſuccout which ruined him onely becauſe he was ſubject to his Will. Grace is changed with Nature: as this is not in her primitive purity, neither
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115672:112"/>is the other in her primitive weakneſs. JESUS CHRIST is come to be the Founder of a New Order in the world; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he findes men in infirmities which they had during the ſtate of Innocence, he furniſheth them with ſtronger Graces, that the Remedie ſurpaſſing the Diſeaſe, may afford them a perfect Cure. When he had to do with <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe vigour was natural, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Forces were not yet divided, he left his Salvation at his own diſpoſal; and giving him a Grace that depended upon his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, made him in ſome ſort the Author of his good or bad for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: but as hee dealeth now with infirme men, whoſe Forces are weakned by Diviſion, he will have their Salvation depend upon his Will, and gives them a Grace, which, ſeizing their heart, makes them victorious in the midſt of their Infirmities. Thence it comes to paſs, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that the Liberty of Man, though never ſo languiſhing, perſeveres in Good by the vertue of JESUS CHRIST, when the Will of <hi>Adam,</hi> with all its vigorous activity, ſtood not out againſt the Temptation. 'Tis the glory of the Son of God, and the aſſurance of a Chriſtian, who comforts himſelf when he ſees that his Salvation is no longer founded upon the Inconſtancie of his Liberty, but upon the Stability of Grace, and certitude of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination. This Belief makes him not more inſolent, becauſe he knows this Myſtery is hid, and that there is not any one upon earth that knows whether his name be written in the Book of Life: It makes him not more lazie, becauſe he is not ignorant that Grace obligeth him to a combat, that Glory is a Triumph that ſucceeds a Victory, and that no body is received into heaven, that hath not ſuffered with JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST upon earth. But this Belief miniſters them Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity in the midſt of all the miſeries of life; it ſweetly mingles Hope with Fear in his ſoul: at the ſight of his Infirmity, he trembles; looking upon the vigour of his Grace, he takes courage; and having had ſo much experience of his frailty, he comforts himſelf that his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtands fixed upon the Rock of Grace: he bleſſeth the mercy of the Almighty, that hath found a ſecret whereby to vanquiſh us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forcing us; which, leaving us our Liberty, fortifies our Weakneſs; and gives us an aſſurance in our Baniſhment, which our firſt Father never had in Paradiſe: For, to conclude this Diſcourſe and this Treatiſe with the words of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;

                        <hi>Virtus &amp; houe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas nomina di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa ſunt; res autem ſubjecta prorſus eadem.</hi> Cicero de Offic.</note> who would perſwade us that whatever is honeſt is vertuous: Wherein I find them little differing from thoſe that place Vertue in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and imagine a crime lawful when it ceaſeth to be ſhameful, and begins to appear honourabble. <hi>Seneca</hi> as proud as he was, hath well taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that this error was prejudicial to vertue, and that the ambitious would no longer court her, when once ſhe ſhould oblige her Partiſans to quit their honour to continue in their duty.</p>
                  <p>Some others not ſo much in love with glory, but more in love with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are perſwaded that Vertue is nothing elſe but a naturall inclination guided by reaſon, and perfected by Science; ſo that to live according to the Laws of Nature, was to live according to the Laws of Vertue. This opinion is approved of by the Stoicks among Philoſophers, and by the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> among Heretiques; It infuſeth blindneſs and arrogance into the ſpirit of thoſe that ſide with it, and the eſteem it puffs them up with of Nature, makes them neglect the aſſiſtance of Grace. It ſeems they would retrive the ſtate of Innocence, that they have a deſign to perſwade us that ſin hath done no hurt to the will of man, that he is as free under the captivity of Concupiſcence, as under the dominion of Original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and that Nature having loſt nothing of her primitive purity, may ſerve for a guide to guilty man, as well as to man an innocent.</p>
                  <p>Others following the Maximes of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> place Vertue in Medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cricy, and leſt they ſhould give the lye to an Infidel, endeavour to ſuit the Maximes of the Goſpel with thoſe of Philoſophy. Seeing that Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality muſt be as far diſtant from Prodigality as from Covetouſneſs; and that Fortitude, if it be true, muſt neither partake of Cowardiſe nor of Raſhneſs; they have confined all other vertues within theſe limits, not conſidering that the nobleſt, and moſt common, find their perfection in their exceſs; For Humility and Charity have no bounds; the one deſcends to ſin and nothingneſs, the other aſcends as high as God who is infinite. Therefore ſays Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Modus amandi Doum ſine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> Bernard.</note> Love hath no meaſure; and conſidering the greatneſs of its object, endeavours to love according, or as much as it is lovely.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt dangerous of all theſe Maſters, are thoſe that confound reaſon with vertue, and conceive man ſufficiently vertuous, when he is rationall; they give a thouſand fair gloſſes to this lye; and making rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the chiefeſt or only good of man, they ſuppoſe they have ſecured him from all vices in deputing him this Idol for the conduct of his life. They will have her a Soveraign whoſe power is lawfull, all whoſe decrees are juſt, and her deſigns laudable. They aſcribe to reaſon what we doe
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115672:114"/>to grace; and not fearing to render her government tyrannicall, they will have her reign abſolutely over the will without conſtraining it, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the underſtanding without dazling it, uſe paſſions without ſtifling them, and employ the body without offering it the leaſt injury or violence: But theſe blind Dotards will not ſee that reaſon being a ſlave, cannot be a Queen; and ſo far is ſhe from guiding man, that ſhe her ſelfe hath need of a ſtar to enlighten her, and a prop to ſupport her. For ſince the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> this Soveraign is a Captive, all her ſubjects ſleight her Laws, and whatever vain Authority ſhe ſlatters her ſelf with, ſhe meets with as many rebellions as ſhe gives commands.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon without Grace, hath hitherto brought up none but proud Scholars; and not to examine what ſhe can doe, ſhe hath yet ſerved for no other uſe, but to ſwel Philoſophers with vain glory, and to perſwade them that Original ſin was a fable, and the corruption of nature an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Idolaters have not ſo much reſiſted the Goſpel as Philoſophers; Superſtition hath with more eaſe ſtruck ſail then vain Philoſophy, and the gods that reaſon faſhioned and ſet up, have ſtood longer then thoſe of wood and of marble.</p>
                  <p>Whatever is rumored of the Letters and Conferences between <hi>Seneca</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I have always believed the converſion of that Stoick har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then that of the Covetous and moſt impudent Laſcivious. The Pride that inanimated his ſpirit, was ſo ſtrong a bulwark againſt grace, that he had never ſtoopt to the Maximes of Chriſtianity, if that Conquereſs of hearts had not employed all her charms and all her forces to bring him under. It had never troubled him to part with his goods,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Annaeo Senecae non quidem ex toto virtus, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ex aliqua parte defuit; affuit enim ſcribenti, ceſuit viventi.</hi> Aug.</note> though avarice be reckoned one of his ſins: be had ſuffered the torments which ſerved for proofs to the Primitive Chriſtians, and his vain-glory had armed him with courage enough to endure thoſe affronts that accompanied the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel. But the love he bore his reaſon had never given him leave to believe, without ſome miraculous work of Grace, that man was born a criminal, that his nature was corrupted, his liberty weakned, and that to the practiſing of vertue, there was requiſite ſome external aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which God might refuſe him without the leaſt ſhew of injuſtice. This Philoſopher had he kept his opinions, had been the firſt Authour of <hi>Pelagianiſme</hi> in the world; and his pride making him the capital enemy of grace, had obliged him to ſide with reaſon againſt her.</p>
                  <p>But not to combat a Hereſie, the Church hath triumphed over ſo many ages ſince; nor to condemn <hi>Seneca</hi> whom ſhe hath anathematized in the perſon of <hi>Pelagius;</hi> It contents me to ſay, that vertue to the end it may be ſolid, muſt be the gift of God: that ſhe cannot be acquired without grace, of whoſe aid being deſtitute, ſhe is rather the ſhadow of vertue, then true and reall vertue indeed. If that of the Heathen be not a ſin, if all the circumſtances of it be not bad, and if we may not blame a ſon that ſuccours his Father, a Subject that deſends his Prince, a Citizen that dies
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115672:115"/>for his Countrey, we have great cauſe to bewail the misfortune of thoſe, who having not the light of faith, could not direct all their actions to their firſt principle, nor refer them to their laſt end.</p>
                  <p>Let us affirm then with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Virtus eſt bona qualitas mertis quae recte vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, qua nemo male utitur, &amp; quam Deus in nobis operatur.</hi> Aug. lib. 1. de lib. arb.</note> the Maſter of Vertue as well as of Grace, that Vertue is a quality of the ſoul, wherewith we live well, which we cannot uſe ill, which God works in us, either to guide us or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us. Let's give a little light to this definiition, and ſay, he cals vertue a quality, becauſe though it be an expreſſion of the Divinity, 'tis not a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance but an accident, to teach man that vertue is not naturall to him but adventitious, and that he receives her as a preſent from the bounteous hand of God; ſhe is good, becauſe ſhe communicates goodneſs to us, and by her motions leads us on to the ſupream Good; ſhe learns us to live well becauſe ſhe knocks us off from our ſelves, lifts us up to God, and makes our intereſts give place to the intereſts of his Glory.</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as mans life is civil, this ſame vertue teacheth us to live well with our neighbour, and to conſpire together to find ſatisfaction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, and felicity in Heaven: We cannot uſe it ill becauſe all her acts are juſt, and ſhe would change her nature ſhould ſhe change her inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nemo virtute abutitur quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis allquando virtus ſit occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio alicujus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li.</hi> Iſidor.</note> Wherein I find vertue happier then the faculties of the ſoul which are daily abuſed in the practiſe of ſin: For the memory is not leſſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full when it repreſents us an injury, then when it minds us of a good turn; The will is not leſſe free when it commits a ſin, then when it practiſeth a vertue, nor hath the underſtanding leſſe vivacity when it conceives an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour then when it conceives a Truth: But Vertue is ſo pure that ſhe cannot be corrupted, her intentions are ſo right they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and her beauty ſo reſplendant, that it admits of no ſpots nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. Finally, tis God that works her in us, becauſe he is the ſource of all our good things, and ſince the havock ſin hath made in men, we have no right to Vertue but what his mercy beſtows upon us.</p>
                  <p>The ignorance of the laſt condition of Vertue hath thrown all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers into pride and blindneſs: For not knowing the miſeries of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, but ſeduced by ſelf-love, they have eſtabliſhed their ſtrength in their freedome, and their happineſs in reaſon; they have given ſtately names to Vertue, which helping to deceive them, have fill'd their perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that ſhe was rather an effect of their own labor, then of Grace; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, that all the Philoſophers conſidering the difficulties that accompany Vertue, &amp; the combats that muſt be fought to gether, have Chriſten'd her with a name which ſeems to take its beeing from force, and which by a juſt judgement of God hath entertained them in their vanity, hiding from them their weakneſs. But Chriſtians, who have learnt humility in the School of Truth, who have profited by their misfortune, and are become wiſe by the miſcarriages of Philoſophers, have called Vertue a Grace, or a gift of God, and will have her name an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their miſery, and of the liberality of their Soveraign.</p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:115672:115"/>
                  <p>This is it that the ſame Doctor ſaith in other terms, oppoſing the vanity of Philoſophers to the humility of Chriſtians; The Philoſophers ſaith he, loved their own glory, and deſpiſed t hat of God; they confided in their own ſtrength, and were not thankfull to him that lifteth up the humble, and caſteth down the proud. But Chriſtians inſtructed in a better School avoid the glory of the world, and ſeek after that of God. The experience they have of their infirmity makes them diſtruſt their own abilities: and ſince they know they can neither undertake nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute any thing without the aſſiſtance of their Creator; they invoke him when they begin their actions, return him thanks when they have finiſhed them, and if they want courage or fidelity, accuſe themſelves confeſſing ingenuouſly, that all good things come from God, and all evil from the creature.</p>
                  <p>Indeed God will be glorified in our weakneſs, he will have all that we do rather an effect of his Grace, then of our Liberty:

It is not a Prodigy, ſaith a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church, to be born upon the Earth and ſcale Heaven; to win that by Vertue that cannot be obtained by Nature: that the whole world may know, that if in this Conflict man get the victory, 'tis God that gives him the Courage to overcome, and the Grace to triumph.</p>

                  <head>The Second DISCOURSE. <hi>Of the Diviſion of the Vertues of a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS Phyſitians make an Anatomy of Mans Body, thereby to diſcover its qualities; and exerciſe a cruelty upon the Dead, that they may benefit the Living: Philoſophers divide the Vertues, that they may know them: they ſeparate that which is indiviſible; and break the ſacred bonds that unite theſe dear Siſters, that ſo they may peruſe their beauties: Or, to expreſs this Truth by a more noble compariſon; as the School-men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Divine Eſſence to illuſtrate its perfections, ſeparating Juſtice from Mercy, Majeſty from Love, Wiſdom from Power, though they are but one and the ſame thing; we are obliged to disjoyn the Vertues, though they be all concentred in Charity, and, according to the opinion of S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> are nothing but Charities diſguiſed.</p>
                  <p>For, taking leave to repeat a Principle often explained in another Work, Charity is the onely Chriſtian Vertue, changing names according as her object changeth conditions: When That is hid, ſhe is called Faith, and with her obſcure lights endeavours to diſcover that Sun which the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his Majeſty renders inviſible: when this object is abſent, ſhe is called Hope, which raiſeth her ſoul towards him that ſtands at a diſtance onely to increaſe our deſires: when 'tis armed with Thunder, ſhe is called Fear, imprinting endearments of reſpect towards a Majeſtie that can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate all thoſe that offend him. Thoſe Vertues that we ſtile Cardinal, and which ſeem not directly to aim at the Supreme Good, are but ſo many true Loves faſtning us to him by different chains. Temperance, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is a chaſte Love, which can ſuffer no parting of hearts; obliging us to conſecrate our ſelves wholly to his ſervice whom we pretend to affect. Valour is a generous Love, making a Pleaſure of Pain; and gives proof of his Conſtancy in the hotteſt battery of Perſecutions. Juſtice is a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Love, teaching us to command by obeying; and ſubjecting us to our lawful Soveraign, gains us an abſolute Dominion over all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Prudence is a clear-ſighted Love which is never ſeduced, chuſing by its illumination thoſe means which are able to bring us to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all others that may eſtrange us from him. So that the Vertues are nothing but Charity in a ſeveral dreſs; or, to ſpeak more correctly, they are onely the different functions of Love.</p>
                  <p>But not to wander from this Principle, which I honour becauſe S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> after Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> is the author of it; I will not forbear to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Vertues without intereſſing their Unity; and to conſider their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115672:116"/>divers employments, without wronging their fair correſpondence. The ſame S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is of opinion that there are Two Principal Vertues which include all the reſt: The one conſiſts in Action, the other in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: The one teacheth us the way we muſt walk in to go to God, and the other happily guides us in it: The one purifies our ſoul by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the other unites us to God by Prayer: The one keeps the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and the other receives the Recompence: The one is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief, becauſe it bewails his ſins with the Penitents; the other is bathed in pleaſure, becauſe it participates in the felicity of the Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Doctor, all whoſe Maximes are Truths, gives us another Diviſion of Vertues, from the difference of our conditions; and being not far from that Principle we are going to explain, attributes but one Vertue to the Bleſſed, and leaves all the reſt to the Faithful. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed finde all their happineſs in the Supreme Good which they are in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of; their Love makes up the total of their felicity; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable Union that transforms them into him they love, is the onely Vertue that for ever takes them up in the fruition of Glory. Prudence is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, becauſe there is no darkneſs to be diſſipated, nor misfortunes to be prevented. Fortitude is uſeleſs, becauſe there are no ſorrows to ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with. Temperance ſerves to no end, becauſe all their delights are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and lawful: Neither is there any employment for their Juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Tabernacle of Glory there are neither miſerable to be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor criminals to be puniſhed. Thus, as that incomparable Doctor goes on, they practiſe but one Vertue; and, by a happie encounter, this Vertue is their recompence; becauſe, uniting them to God, it makes them finde their felicity in him.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, that as the Supreme Good contains all other Goods, we may ſay alſo that all the Vertues are comprehended in this, and their ſeveral denominations may be impoſed upon it. It is Prudence, becauſe it illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates them with the brightneſs of God himſelf: Fortitude, becauſe it unites them ſo firmly with him, that nothing can ſeparate them: Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, becauſe it makes them chaſtly embrace the Chief Good, and in the delights they taſte of, they ſeek not ſo much their Pleaſure as his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Juſtice, becauſe it ſubjects them to their Soveraign, making them finde their Happineſs in their Submiſſion.</p>
                  <p>But as there is ſome analogie between the condition of the Bleſſed and that of the Faithful, at the ſame time that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſeparates them, he aſſociates them again; and confounding their Vertues together, ſaith, that during this life Love is the onely vertue of Chriſtians, and that there is none other but to love that which is amiable: So that, to facilitate the acquiſition of that object we place our affections upon, by chuſing ſutable and convenient means, is Prudence: Not to be diſcouraged or diverted by Grief, is Fortitude: Not to be drawn away by Pleaſures, is Temperance; and not to be kept off by the vain pomp and grandetza's of the world, is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115672:117"/>Juſtice. He lodgeth theſe Vertues in Glory, which he ſeems to have ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed thence; and acknowledgeth that the Bleſſed enjoy them as well as the Faithful; but with this difference, That upon the earth they are in Act, in heaven in Habit; upon the earth they ſerve for a Defence, in heaven for an Ornament; upon the earth in Exerciſe, in heaven in their Acquieſcence; upon the earth they are the ſure Land-marks guiding the Faithful to their journeys end, in heaven they happily unite the Faithful in an inſeparable Bond of Communion.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this Doctrine is not fully conformable to that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received, and that we have borrowed from Philoſophers the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the Quality of Vertues; let us ſay with them, that we judge of their number by our obligations and our neceſſities: We are upon the earth for no other end, but to Know and Love, to Suffer and to Do; our whole life is ſpent in theſe two employments; and if we be not abſolutely unprofitable, we muſt raiſe our ſelves to the Knowledge and Love of the Supreme Good; and reſolve, if we be not altogether lazie, by our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to overcome all the difficulties which occur in the courſe of our life. Thence it comes to paſs that we have need of different Vertues,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bonam vitam ego puto &amp; De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um cognoſcere &amp; amare, &amp; mala pati &amp; bona facere, &amp; ſic perſeverare uſque ad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Bern.</note> and that according to the deſignes we form, we are obliged ſometimes to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Divine vertues, ſometimes to the Moral.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as God is ſurrounded with Light that darkens us, our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding muſt neceſſarily be cleared by Faith, that we may know him: In that he is an Infinite Good, our ſoul muſt be fortified with Hope, that we may ſearch after him; and our Will warmed with Charity, that we may love him. For though Good be amiable, and the Supreme Good tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently amiable; yet is it ſo far above our reach, that without Grace we cannot approach unto it: and as we muſt be clarified by his Light, that we may know him; ſo muſt we be warmed by his Calentures, that we may affectionately cloſe with him. Thus Faith, Hope and Charity are the Vertues by means whereof we treat with God. But becauſe Man is born for Society, in ſerving God he is bound to aſſiſt his Neighbour: Charity hath a double reſpect, having united us to the Supreme Good, for love of it, ſhe unites us to our Like, and obligeth us to love them as we do our ſelves. Were this Vertue in its full vigour, 'twould be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent alone:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lex venit in ſubſidium ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citiae.</hi> Atiſtot.</note> and as Philoſophers have obſerved that Laws would be uſeleſs, did Friendſhip raign in mens hearts; I dare affirm, did Charity ſet up her throne in ours, the Vertues would be idle among Chriſtians, or act onely by her orders and directions.</p>
                  <p>But whether we have not as yet attained this Perfection, or that the number of Subjects contributes to the Greatneſs of Soveraigns; ſhe hath under her command Four Vertues, which are called Cardinal, that act by her motions, and execute her deſignes.</p>
                  <p>Prudence clears our Underſtandings to act, helps us to diſcern Good from Evil, and Truth from Falſhood: For as there are Evils which under a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115672:117"/>fair ſhew deceive us, and Lyes that finde more credit then ſome Truths, Prudence muſt ſerve us for a Guide, and in ſo important an election ſecure us from miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice gives every one his due, makes our Intereſts yeeld to Reaſon, preſerves Peace in the inequality of our conditions, and taking original righteouſneſs for an example which made a harmony between foul and body, this ſets Man at union with himſelf, and by a neceſſary conſequence accommodates him with his neighbour. Therefore is it that Repentance and Humility are as rivulets flowing from this Fountain, and as rays iſſuing from this Sun: For Repentance is nothing but a ſevere Juſtice that ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the ſinner againſt himſelf, that obliges him to act the part of a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in accuſing, of a judge in condemning, of an executioner in puniſhing himſelf. Humility is nothing but a modeſt and true Juſtice, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Majeſtie of the Creator, forceth the Creature to fall down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and, upon the ſight of ſin and nothingneſs, to adore the Power and Mercy that drew him out of theſe two Abyſſes.</p>
                  <p>Temperance regulates our Pleaſures, and moderates our Delights, leſt their diſorder obſtruct our ſalvation, and, out of a blinde impetuoſity, finde Pain and Sorrow where we look for Pleaſure and Content. 'Tis true, ſhe is not ſo taken up with Particular good, as not to watch over the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: For, without encroaching upon the rights and priviledges of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſhe calms the Paſſions, allays the ſtorms, and producing a tranquillity in the ſoul of Particulars, contributes to that of Kingdoms; becauſe the quiet of States depends upon that of Families; and 'tis very hard that thoſe Subjects that yeeld not obedience to the laws of Temperance, ſhould to thoſe of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>But as ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> Sufferings are as common as Actings, and man ſpends his life in Pain as well as in Labour; to theſe Three Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is added Fortitude, as a Supply to combat and vanquiſh Griefs that ſet upon us. Indeed, the chiefeſt employment of Fortitude is to wreſtle with whatever is moſt troubleſom in the world: It skirmiſheth with thoſe accidents that diſquiet our Health, or concern our Honour; is armed againſt Fortune; and, defying that blinde potentate that ſeems the enemy of Vertue, ſtands ready to receive all the aſſaults this inſolent Tyranneſs makes upon thoſe that ſlight her Empire. Indeed, when Valour is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Faith, ſhe laughs at an Idol who ſubſiſts onely in the mindes of thoſe that fear it, and may be called the work of their Fancie and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: ſhe trembles not at the attempts of a falſe Deity; and being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that every thing is regulated by a Supreme Providence which cannot fail, lays an obligation upon us to adore his Decrees, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us, and kiſs his Thunders, though they ſtrike us dead. Thus, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the favourable ſhadow of theſe Vertues, the life of a Chriſtian paſſeth on calmly: Faith affords him light to illuminate him; Charity, heats to inflame him; Hope promiſes to encourage him; Juſtice and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115672:118"/>their ſeverall ſupplies to put him in action; and Fortitude who her ſelf is a whole Army, gives undauntedneſs of ſpirit to fight and to triumph.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe Diviſions this may be added, namely, that man being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a body and a ſoul, hath need of Vertues that may unite them together, and ſubjecting the ſoul to God, may ſubject the body to the ſoul; For there is this order between theſe two parts, that the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not the laws of the minde, but as far as the mind reſpects the laws of God: aſſoon as one diſpenſeth with his duty, the other failes of his obedience; and at the ſame time that the ſoul rebels againſt God, the fleſh maketh an inſurrection againſt the ſoul. To this day we bewail the miſchiefs of this rebellion, and all the Vertues are given us only to re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate us in our Primitive Tranquillity. The Theological Vertues under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſubject the mind to God: Faith captivates the Underſtanding, and obligeth it to believe thoſe verities it comprehends not: Hope fils the Memory with the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt; and Charity ſweetly divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the will from all periſhable goods, to fixe it upon the Supream Good. The Vertues that are called Cardinal,

But becauſe I deſtine another Diſcourſe to treat of theſe laſt Vertues, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my ſelf bound to beſtow the remainder of this upon the former, and to ſhew the reaſons wherefore it was requiſite that the Chriſtian muſt be aſſiſted with Faith, Hope, and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Grace hath ſome reſemblance with Nature, and we find in man ſome Image of a Chriſtian. Man cannot come to his End, unleſs he know it, and have ſome aſſurance of a poſſibility to obtain it. The Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move towards God, his ſole end, unleſs he know him by Faith, love him by Charity, and promiſe himſelfe the enjoyment of him by Hope. Man, that he may work aright, hath need of three ſuccours; he muſt know what he does, he muſt be able to doe it, and he muſt will it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all his deſigns will be unprofitable, nor will he form any enterpriſe which will not confound or grieve him. The Chriſtian, whoſe ſalvation is his chiefe buſineſs, hath need of the ſame aids: but becauſe his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe is extreamly difficult, and ſin that hath made ſtrange devaſtations in his ſoul, hath ſpread darkneſs over his Rational, thrown weakneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Iraſcible, and ſcattered malice into his Concupiſcible faculty; Faith muſt enlighten the one, Hope ſatisfie the other, and Charity, which is nothing but an effuſion of the Divine Goodneſs, ſhed it ſelf into the laſt and amend it: Or, let us ſay, that Faith diſcovers the Supream Good to the Chriſtian by its Lights; that thence there ariſe two affections in his ſoul; the deſire of poſſeſſing it, which is love; and a confidence of obtaining
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115672:118"/>it, which is Hope. Theſe three Vertues doe conſummate the Chriſtians perfection: Faith illuminates him, Hope elevates him, and Charity uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to God, makes him partake in ſame ſort of the felicity of the Bleſſed.</p>

                  <p>GOd is ſo far above our apprehenſion by the Greatneſs of his Nature, that in whatever ſtate we conſider him, we have only a borrowed light to know him by: In that happy condition wherein Innocence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd all mans darkneſs, ſuffering neither ignorance nor infirmity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in theſe ſins, which are rather naturall then voluntary: he had need of light to know him whoſe Image he had the honour to be. Thoſe infuſed verities he received in his Creation, thoſe faithful glaſſes that preſented him his Creator, and all the beauties of the Univerſe that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his Divine perfections, had imprinted in him but a faint know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if Faith elevating his ſoul had not clarified him with its brightneſſe. But when man ſhall paſs from Earth to Heaven, and removing from the Order of Grace ſhall enter into that of Glory,

                        </hi> Pſal. 35.</note> he ſhall ſtill have need of a borrowed light to behold the Divine Eſſence. Though he be then a pure Spirit, and his ſoul abſtracted from matter act as the Angels, yet all our Divines confeſs, that his darkneſs muſt be enlightned, his weakneſs ſupported, that he may contemplate this Divine Sun, who by a rare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy hides himſelf in light, and covers himſelf with his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>We are not therefore to wonder if Faith be neceſſary for man in the ſtate whereto ſin hath reduced him,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Intellectus hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manus ſe habet ad Divina ſicut viſus noctuae ſe habet ad ſolem.</hi> Ariſt.</note> and that he cannot know God if he be not irradiated with his Grace: For he is in reſpect of the things of God, according to the judgement of Philoſophers themſelves, as thoſe Birds of night which cannot endure the beams of the Sun, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to hide themſelves when that glorious Star appears, leſt they ſhould be dazled with his rays: ſo that man is bound to renounce his reaſon, and to give his judgement the lie if he will comprehend the Truths and Myſteries of Religion. Thence it is that the Fathers of the Church have ſaid,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nemo novit fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium niſi pater, neque Patrem quis novit niſi filius, &amp; cui filius voluerit revelare.</hi> Mat. 11.</note> that he could not know the deſigns of God if he were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of them by Revelation; nor believe them if he were not perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Faith, nor ought at all to reſt in them, if he that contriv'd them had not commented upon them by himſelf or by his Miniſters; Becauſe as the great Saint <hi>Hila y</hi> ſaith, we muſt not believe Divine things, but when God pleaſeth to reveal them, becauſe he alone knows them, and is able to diſcover them to others.</p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:115672:119"/>
                  <p>Thus muſt we confeſs, that if Faith came not in to our ſuccour, there would be a ſtrange confuſion in the belief of our Myſteries: For as mens opinions are as different as their minds, their reaſon doubtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, approving in one Countrey, what it condemns in another, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges judgements according to Climates, and in one and the ſame man grows weaker or ſtronger with age; we had for ever ſloated in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and our belief had been as ſubject to change as our opinion. Wherefore God dealing with all Chriſtians alike, hath given them the ſame light: and not reſpecting their naturall advantages is pleaſed that the ſimple and the learned have one and the ſame principle to know his Myſteries by.</p>
                  <p>But had not this conſideration obliged him to beſtow upon us one and the ſame Faith to entertain us in the ſame mind; the extent and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of the things we believe, had always required the ſame Oeconomy: For ſome aſcend into Heaven, others goe down into Hel; ſome are buried in the obſcurity of what is paſt, others are hid in the abyſſes of what's to come; ſome happened at the birth of the world, others ſhall not happen till its decay; ſo that there being no natural light vaſt enough to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all theſe marvels, ſeparated by the diſtance of place or time, we muſt of neceſſity be illuminated with a Divine light which may collect them all; and without giving us a clear underſtanding, give us at leaſt a ſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p>Having ſo great an obligation to Faith, 'tis all the reaſon in the world we ſhould be acquainted with the nature of that which makes us know all things, and be inform'd of the definition of a vertue that ſerves for the baſis and foundation of all others. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cals it in one place an obſcure light, which having the certitude of Science, wants evidence and perſpicuity. For 'tis a Truth that Faith clears us, that 'tis an effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Light of Glory, and an emanation of that admirable clarity that diſcovers all things to the bleſſed. <hi>A Light ſhining,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, but in an obſcure and dark place, <hi>in Caliginoſo loco.</hi> 'Tis a Star wrapt in a Cloud, an <hi>Aurora</hi> that knits the ſhadows of the night with the brightneſs of the day; its obſcurity conſtitutes one part of its Eſſence; when it becomes evident it changeth its nature, and ceaſing to be Faith, begins to be Science or Revelation. Thus the Chriſtians are like thoſe people, who for the ſpace of ſix Moneths ſee no Sun, yet becauſe that glorious Luminary wheels continually round their Horizon, they may boaſt their nights not to be without ſome brightneſs; and though depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the preſence of the Sun, want not altogether his Light.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>John Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that Faith is the baſis of Religion; that 'tis in this ſpiritual building what foundations are in houſes, and that as theſe cannot ſubſiſt when removed from their groundſils, ſo doth a man ceaſe being a Chriſtian aſſoon as he leaves off to be a Believer. Indeed all the Vertues lean upon this, and by a particular priviledge ſhe is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115672:119"/>without others, but others are not preſerved without her: Their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence weakens her; and Faith, not quickned with Charity, nor ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Hope, hath no vigour, becauſe, in the judgement of an Apoſtle, it is then dead. Nevertheleſs this ſpark lives under the aſhes; and though never ſo weak and languiſhing, may, with the benign influence of heaven, produce ſome effects.</p>
                  <p>But S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> whoſe wit is no leſs ſolid then agreeable,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fides eſt quaeda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voluntaria &amp; certa praelibatio nondu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> propala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae veritatis.</hi> Bernar.</note> gives us an excellent definition of Faith, when he ſaith, 'Tis like a voluntary and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red prejudice of a Truth not yet evident: For 'tis certain that Faith is not onely an Earneſt of the Truths we believe, but as it were an Antepaſt and Prelibation of them: we ſee them not evidently, but we believe them certainly; we finde that its Obſcurity produceth Light, and that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is oftentimes the recompence of its Firmneſs. <hi>If ye believe not, ye ſhall not underſtand.</hi> So that we may ſay, As in Chriſtianity Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs produceth ſtrength, Obſcurity many times produceth Evidence. Thus S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defining Faith, calls it ſometimes a Light guiding the minde to the Prime verity; and by obſcure and cloudy paſſages, leads it ſecurely into the region of Light.</p>
                  <p>For all this, we muſt acknowledge that the fulleſt definition of Faith is that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſt autem Fides ſperandarum ſubſtanmia reru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, argumentum non apparenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</hi> Hebr. 11.</note> where he calls this Vertue <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> and <hi>the argument of thoſe not ſeen:</hi> For as Subſtance is the ſupport of Accidents, Faith is the pillar of Vertues, and the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable baſis of the Spiritual building, becauſe 'tis founded upon the Prime verity. It looks upon the things we hope for, becauſe they are more noble then thoſe that we poſſeſs; and this generous vertue leaving the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Mediums, ſoareth as high as the contemplation of the laſt End. It is alſo an argument of thoſe things we ſee not, becauſe it gives us a certitude, and, without exhibiting them to our view, ſettles in us ſo ſtrong a perſwaſion of them, that all the reaſons in the world cannot alter our belief: But its principal advantage, and which is happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in this definition, is, that as it is called <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> becauſe it is the earneſt of them, giving us, in ſome ſort, what it hath promiſed; ſo is it <hi>the demonſtration of things not ſeen,</hi> becauſe it makes them in a manner viſible, and its obſcurity begets in our ſouls light and certitude.</p>
                  <p>Having conſidered its eſſence, 'tis fit we conſider its properties and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which are ſo great, it ſelf muſt come in to gain them belief: For the Scripture ſeems to attribute to Faith whatever is moſt auguſt and reverential in Scripture: It is the Principle of ſpiritual life; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the language of Saint <hi>Paul, the juſt</hi> doth <hi>live by Faith.</hi> For though the liſe of a Chriſtian be compoſed of many parts,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Initium bonae vitae, cui vita etiam debetur aeterna, rectafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des eſt.</hi> Aug.</note> as the body is of many members; and to be in a vigorous condition, which is the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome of perfect health, Faith muſt be animated with good works; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs Faith is the firſt principle, and, without it, every one confeſſeth
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:115672:120"/>all vertues are dead or languiſhing: Therefore when S. <hi>Bernard</hi> calls Charity the life of the ſoul, he acknowledgeth at the ſame time that Faith conceives her, Hope brings her forth, the holy Spirit forms her, Reading ſuckles her, Meditation nouriſheth her, and Prayer fortifies her.</p>
                  <p>As Faith is the life of the ſoul, ſo is it alſo the eye; and he that takes it not for his Guide, ſhall never come to Glory: it enlightens all the other vertues, and penetrates thoſe clouds of darkneſs that ſurround them: 'Tis alſo an obſervation S. <hi>Bernard</hi> hath made, that Chriſt was never ſo cloſely hid, but Faith always diſcovered him: If he be Incarnate in the womb of his mother, Faith does him homage in the perſon of S. <hi>John:</hi> If he be born in a manger, Faith adores him with the Wiſe-men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Word in Infancie, Majeſtie in Baſeneſs, and Power in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity: If he be preſented in the Temple, Faith receives him in the arms of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and makes his Elogie by the mouth of that aged Saint: If he enter the river of <hi>Jordan</hi> to be baptized among ſinners, Faith manifeſts him by the teſtimony of his Precurſor, and teacheth us that he is <hi>the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world:</hi> If he die upon the Croſs, or loſe his honour with his life, Faith acknowledgeth his Innocence in the midſt of his Puniſhment, and begs a ſhare in his Kingdom by the mouth of the good Thief: If he be veiled upon our Altars, and the outward ſpecies of the Sacrament conceal him from our eyes, Faith adores him in the perſon of Believers, and diſcovers his ſplendour under the clouds that encompaſs him. This made S. <hi>Bernard</hi> utter thoſe excellent words, That Faith was very quick-ſighted, becauſe it acknowledged Chriſt born in the Manger, and dying upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>But as if one ſole vertue made up all our Glory, I finde that our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt qualities take their being from its merit: For if we be the children of God, 'tis becauſe we are Believers; and the great Apoſtle, that deſcribes the prerogatives of Mans nature, diſcovering the humiliations of the Word Incarnate, obſerves expreſly, that the quality of the children of God is an appendix of Faith; and that heaven ſhall not be our inheritance, but becauſe this vertue was the principle of our Filiation: <hi>He gave them power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe in his Name.</hi> This auguſt quality is not indulged us in Baptiſm, but becauſe there we receive Faith; and 'tis ſo truely the effect of that Sacrament, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever that gives proof of his Creed in the midſt of torments, fails not to be the childe of God, though he be not baptized.</p>
                  <p>If Faith advance us to dignity, it alſo communicates power to us; it gives Reputation to our Dominion, that it grow not contemptible; and makes us in ſome ſort abſolute in the State of our Maſter. For the gift of Miracles is a priviledge of Faith: Theſe Prodigies that aſtoniſh the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, convert Nations, make Tyrants tremble, tame Devils, are donatives heaven hath promiſed to Faith rather then to Charity. Every thing is poſſible to him that believeth: this vertue may boaſt it ſelf abſolute; and,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115672:120"/>as if it were inſeparable from Soveraignty, it ſeems he that is a Believer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes powerful: Thoſe men of renown whoſe Elogies Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes in his Epiſtles, owe all their priviledges to Faith: 'Tis by it that they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Tyrants, changed Nature, diſordered the Seaſons, and altered the Elements: It ſerves us for a Conduct in Peace, and a Defence in War; and whenever the Apoſtle arms the Chriſtians, he gives them nothing but Faith either to aſſault or repel their enemies: He Chriſtens one and the ſame thing with divers names; and calling it ſometimes a Buckler, ſometimes a Breſtplate, ſometimes a Sword, lets us ſee that 'tis ſufficient to procure as many victories as it ſtands aſſaults, or ſights battels. Finally, it ſeems God takes pleaſure to faſten our Power to our Infirmity; and treating us like <hi>Samſon,</hi> all whoſe ſtrength lay in his hair, he will teach all the world that the Miracles we work are not ſo much the effects of our Ability as of his Grace. For Faith is nothing but a ſubmiſſion of minde, and a blinde obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which, holding more of Credulity then Argument, ſeems rather a mark of our Weakneſs then of our Strength. In the mean time, the Son of God, that hath a minde to humble us in raiſing us up, and to manifeſt his greatneſs in our abaſement, hath founded our ability upon belief, and is pleaſed that the gift of Miracles ſhould be the recompence of our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity.</p>
                  <p>But nothing more aſtoniſheth me,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Creditis quia ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſum faccre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vobis? dicunt ci, Utique, Domine, Tunctetigit ocu. los coru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diceus, Secundum filem veſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fiat vobis</hi> Matth. 9.</note> then to conſider that God hath in ſome ſort ſubjected his own Power to our Faith; and before he would heal the ſick, or raiſe the dead, he requires our Belief as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to his Miracles: For he never undertook any Cure, but he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Patient to believe; and if he were not in a condition to uſe his own Underſtanding, he demanded that diſpoſition in the Aſſiſtants or Witneſſes. The ſame Evangeliſt obſerves, that his power was manacled by the Infidelity of ſinners,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Et non poterat ibi virtutem ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam facere, &amp; mirabatur pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem corum.</hi> Matth. 6.</note> and that there were ſome Towns where he could work no Miracles, becauſe he found no Faith among them.</p>
                  <p>We need not wonder that the Son of God hath ſo greatly honoured this vertue, becauſe it gives him ſo much obedience; and that of all the Sacrifices the Chriſtian can offer him, this ſeems the hardeſt and moſt honourable: For, it makes an Oblation of our Underſtanding, takes from us the liberty of reaſoning in our Myſteries; it perſwades us what we underſtand not; and conteſting at the ſame time againſt Reaſon and Senſe, makes a perfect Holocauſt of the Chriſtian: It reduceth that inſolent undertaker, who would know every thing in Paradiſe, to believe all without knowing any thing: it makes him purchaſe Faith with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his Reaſon; and it ſeems that to render him Faithful, it will not ſuffer him to be Rational.</p>
                  <p>Though Faith have all theſe advantages, yet muſt we acknowledge that without Charity it is unprofitable; all a mans Miracles profit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without Good works: and though this vertue raign ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the State of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe will never cauſe the Faithful to raign
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115672:121"/>in Glory, if he adde not the ardors of Love to the Light of Belief. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> hath obſerved, that though <hi>Abraham</hi> owe the beginning of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Faith, he owed the perfection thereof to his Good works and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: when he believed the Word of God, 'twas a rare effect of Faith; but when he obeyed the voice of the Angel, armed his hand with a Sword, lifted up his arm to ſtrike his onely ſon, 'twas doubtleſs a very great act of Faith, and a certain proof of his obedience. Let us joyn therefore theſe two vertues, that we may imitate him: let us paſs from Faith to Good works; and if we would have the merit of that Patriarch, let us fully believe the promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, and faithfully execute his will, that we may not be reproacht that our Faith is like that of Devils, that fear the Juſtice of the Almighty, but love not his Goodneſs.</p>

                  <p>AS Sin hath robbed us of our Light, ſo hath it deprived us of our Strength; and he that caſt us into Errour, hath precipitated us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Weakneſs: we are not onely Blinde, but Impotent; nor is it a ſufficient Cure for us to have our Sight reſtored, if withal we recover not our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. Faith takes pains to ſcatter our Darkneſs, and Hope endeavours to ſtrengthen our Weakneſs. This vertue bears up the heart of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, draws him out of that unhappie Impotencie whereto ſin had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him; and reſting upon the veracity of God, expects with confidence the effects of his promiſes: it knows very well that his Word is not like that of Soveraigns; and being not ſubject to their Infirmities, neither is he liable to their Changes.</p>
                  <p>For Princes oftentimes break their word, either out of weakneſs, or lightneſs, or imprudence: they cannot always do what they would; their Will exceeds their Power; and they are conſtrained to recal their word, becauſe they are not able to put it in execution. 'Tis enough that they are Men, to make them Lyers: The Scepter that adorns their hand, and the Royal Wreathe that circles their head, change not their Nature; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Throne they are ſenſible of the failings of their Subjects; and though the diſpoſers of Honour and Life, yet are they inconſtant as their Mothers. But were they reſolved to keep their word, that they might imitate his Conſtancie whoſe Majeſtie they repreſent, they would be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forc'd to revoke it, to avoid thoſe diſorders their Prudence had not foreſeen: for the Light of Kings is bounded as well as their Power; they cannot read the obſcure Characters of Futurity; and whatever miniſters
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115672:121"/>their Councel is compoſed of, they cannot prevent accidents if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult not with Prophets; ſo that neceſſity compels them to fail of their word, if they will not fail of their duty.</p>
                  <p>But the God we adore is free from theſe infirmities: and if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſometimes to repent of his deſigns, or recall his decrees, 'tis only to ſuit with our underſtanding, and to deal with men after the manner of men: He is abſolute in his ſtate, his Power is his Will, as his Goodneſs is his Eſſence; he finds no Rebels in the world, and if there be any that ſeem to brave his Mercy, they obey his Juſtice that puniſheth them: His Immutability is equall to his Power, he never changeth his deſigns; and though he accommodate himſelf ſometimes to his creatures, 'tis in redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to his Will without conſtraining them. He magnifieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this Attribute in Holy Scripture; and as if his Conſtancy were a proof of his Divinity, he will have us believe him God, becauſe he is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, <hi>Ego Deus &amp; non mutor.</hi> A ſurpriſal or a miſtake obligeth him not to change his reſolution; nothing happens in his State contrary to his Will, or his Permiſſion; he prevents the revolts of his Subjects, and if his Juſtice puniſh Crimes in Time, his Wiſdome foreſaw them in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; His Councel regulates Events, Succeſſe anſwers his Enterpriſes, and the malice of men not being able to ſurpriſe his Providence, he is never forced to revoke his Decrees.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſſe that Hope which is founded upon his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, is not liable to diſtruſt; 'tis well aſſured that Truth can neither deceive nor be deceived; that an abſolute power meets with no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that check it; and that a wiſdome ſubject to no errour, is ſubject to no change. Thus the Chriſtian aſſiſted with this Vertue, lives in the ſweetneſs of tranquillity; nothing in the whole world makes him afraid, the greatneſs of danger heightens his confidence, and knowing very well that God can raiſe his ſalvation out of his very fall, he is fearleſs in the midſt of his enemies. This made <hi>David</hi> utter thoſe words, <hi>In Domino ſperans non infi mabor;</hi> he could not have ſaid ſo, had he placed his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the creature, becauſe as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, it fell with man who was its ſupport; but being grounded upon him who is as Powerfull as he is True, he was able to preſerve his aſſurance in the midſt of danger, and to promiſe victory in the thickeſt of the conflict.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> paraphraſe upon the words of the ſame Prophet, where out of an exceſs of confidence he cals his God his Hope; <hi>Quoniam tu es Domine spes mea.</hi> Let other men, ſaith that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Doctor, truſt in the vanity of their riches, and think that with their gold they can ſeduce Women, corrupt Judges, and ſubdue their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; Let others confide in their Friends, and perſwade themſelves they have a ſhare in their goods as well as in their affections; that aſſiſted by their counſell, or ſupported by their furtherance, they can triumph over grief and fortune: Let others raiſing their thoughts a degree higher, hope
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115672:122"/>in the weak power of Kings, promiſe themſelves admittance into their favour, to be of their Councel, to partake of their Secrets, and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Perſon or their State; as for me who am no longer abuſed with theſe vanities, I will reſt upon my God, and not violating the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I owe him, making the Almighty my Hope, will ſay, <hi>Quoniam tu es Domiue spes mea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this Vertue heighten the infirmity of Chriſtians, we muſt confeſs it ſweetens their diſcontents, and is in ſtead of Conſolation, midſt all the torments that afflict them. Not to know that man is miſerable ſince he became criminal, is to be extreamly ignorant; the ſweeteſt life hath its labours; the ſhorteſt is long enough to be ſenſible of a thouſand ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities; the remedies whereof are a ſecond affliction; and that which we call comfort and conſolation, is often a diſguiſed miſery, and a reall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Among ſo many adverſities, Heaven that watcheth over the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Chriſtians hath furniſhed them with Hope, which never confounds thoſe it aſſiſts: for it awakens their courage with recompenſes, ſtirres them up by the examples of former Saints, quickens them by the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their life, and making them balance what they ſuffer with what they expect, gives them occaſion to ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, Non ſunt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignae Paſſiones hujus temporis ad futuram gloriam quae revelatur in nobis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as Jeſus Chriſt is the principal object of this Vertue, hence ariſeth the ſtrongeſt comfort it can beſtow upon us; for repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us his Shame and his Glory, his Death and his Reſurrection, it makes us patiently ſuffer the afflictions of this preſent life in conſideration of the advantages of the future. The Son of God, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the hope of the Faithful, they behold in him labour and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence: labour in his Paſſion, recompence in his Reſurrection; and in theſe two ſtates rather different then contrary, they behold two kinds of lives, whereof the one being miſerable and preſent, muſt be indured with courage; the other being happy and future, muſt be expected with patience. Jeſus Chriſt hath manifeſted the former in his Croſſe, the ſecond in his Glory, to the end that having born the former in this world, they may hope to poſſeſſe the ſecond in the other world.</p>
                  <p>Though this Example be able to encourage the moſt fearful, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the moſt afflicted, we muſt acknowledge nevertheleſſe that the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we have, that God wil not forſake thoſe that are his is a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſolation: which is indeed the reaſon Hope makes uſe of to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Chriſtians; nor was ever expreſt more eloquently then in the words of the Pſalmiſt, who repreſenting them the power of their Soveraign, obligeth them to hope all things and fear nothing.
<note place="margin">Ideo nihil dicit ut omnia dicat, &amp; tu omnia credas.</note> 
                     <hi>Spera in Deo &amp; ipſe faciet.</hi> In a word, it mentions all in naming nothing, and giving no bounds to its promiſes, ſuffers us to hope every thing from God; it inſtructs us by ſilence, leaves us to think what it expreſſeth not, and leſt ſome favours
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115672:122"/>might be forgotten in the rehearfall, chuſeth rather to be altogether ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then to forget any.</p>
                  <p>If I may ſerve for his Interpreter, me thinks his meaning is, that from the Almighty power of God we may expect every thing; That he will ſtop the Sun, ſhake the Earth, remove the Mountains from their ſtations, open the abyſſes of the ſea, and do an hundred miracles for our ſakes, if we hope in his goodneſs: or this Vertue will have us underſtand, that God will heal us if we be ſick, that he will comfort us if we be afflicted, enrich us if we be poor, reſtore us to liberty if we be in priſon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the grave when we are dead: Finally, we may hope all that he can do; our hope is as large as his power; and without raſhneſſe we may expect as many favours as he can work miracles.</p>
                  <p>Seeing this Vertue is as lowly as generous, it keeps us from complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when ſucceſſes anſwer not our deſires; and teacheth us, that there are two wayes whereby God aſſiſts us when we are perſecuted; the One is glittering and full of pomp, ſhowrs aſtoniſhment into the ſoul of our Enemies, tameth lions that would devour us, quencheth flames that would burn us to aſhes, and diſarms Executioners that are ready to ſacrifice us: The other is more reſerv'd and leſs ſplendid; for not delivering us from torments, it gives us courage to bear them, makes us victorious by endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and working the miracle in our ſelves, ſweetens not the cup of our puniſhment, but increaſeth our conſtancy, whereby we triumph over it. The former of theſe wayes appeared in the three Children, who were thrown into a fiery furnace by the command of a heathen Prince: The fire ſpar'd their clothes, reſpected their bodies; and having conſumed their chains that they might walk at liberty, ſought out their Executioners to execute vengeance upon them. The ſecond appeared in the perſon of the Maccabees, who vanquiſh'd in ſuffering, tired their Enemies, and in an age that trembles at the frowns of a Maſter, laughed at the fury of a Tyrant. Might I paſs my judgment upon theſe two Miracles, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the later; and had I liberty to chuſe, I would rather be in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Maccabees, then in that of the companions of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But leaving this Digreſſion to purſue my Diſcourſe: Hope is not founded upon promiſes, but upon aſſurances: it hath earneſts that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates all doubts; and conſidering what hath paſſed, eaſily beleeves what is yet to come: For though God be the ſupreme Verity, though his words be Oracles, and reaſon it ſelf perſwades us, that he promiſeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his ſubjects he does not perform; yet is he ſo good, he gives them earneſt of his promiſes; and as if he were afraid to weary their hope in making them expect too much, he ſweetens their anxious pains by pledges of affection, which make up a part of that ſumm he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them; he gives us favours, whereby we are enabled to hope for what remains behinde; the death he ſuffered for us, is an aſſurance of that life he prepares for us; neither can we doubt (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi>)
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115672:123"/>that we ſhall not reign with him in heaven, ſeeing he was willing to die for us upon the Croſſe. For what Goods may we not expect, when his death is a pledge of his love, and an aſſurance of the happineſſe we look for? Let us hope then for his Kingdom; and when the greatneſſe of his promiſes ſhall raiſe any doubts in our ſoul, let us conſider the greatneſs of our Surety, and we ſhall ſecurely wait the accompliſhment of our deſires.</p>
                  <p>Having conſidered the neceſſity of this Vertue, 'tis juſt that we conſider its Nature, and conſulting the Divines and Fathers, be acquainted with its Definition. <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew calls it the Fore-runner of Joy, a Harbinger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure preceding the Eternall one, an antepaſt of Bleſſedneſs; ſo that following the opinion of this Philoſopher, he that hopes, may boaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf happy before-hand. The Maſter of the Sentences comes neer this ſenſe, when defining this Vertue, he calls it a certain aſſurance of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Felicity; the certitude that accompanies it, ſweetens the pain which the remoteneſs of the Good it waits for, occaſions; and ſhe thinks her ſelf happy becauſe the felicity ſhe promiſeth is certain. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> calls it by a more magnificent name, and making it paſſe for a view of the ſupreme Good, ſeems with <hi>Philo</hi> to confound it with Joy: for he ſaith, that Faith cures the eys of the ſoul, and that Hope makes her ſee what ſhe deſires.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe things never appear ſo clearly as when they are oppoſed with contraries, I conceive, I cannot better diſcover the nature of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Hope, then by confronting it with that that deceives men by the vanity of its promiſes: This then is uncertain, doubt makes up a part of its Eſſence; and by a misfortune inſeparable from it, it ceaſeth to be Hope as ſoon as it begins to be ſure: Therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, ſhe promiſed a doubtfull good, and to her very favourites leaves all things dubious and uncertain: But the Hope of a Chriſtian is ſure, his certitude commenſurate, and all men that define it make it ſynoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous with Aſſurance. That of Men is falſe, what-ever fair colours its promiſes are dreſs'd with; it cannot avoyd the denomination of a Lye: Therefore the ſame Scripture that calls it <hi>uncertain,</hi> calls it a <hi>lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> and finding nothing vain enough whereby to expreſſe its eſſence, compares it to Dreams, that abuſe men in their ſleep, <hi>Vana ſpes &amp; men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacium viro inſenſato; ſomnia extollunt imprudentem:</hi> ſo that thoſe that give ear unto it are like thoſe poor Dreamers, who being rich onely whileſt they ſleep, loſe all as ſoon as they awake: their ſleep en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth them, and when they awake they are plundred of all, and reduc'd to their former poverty: But the Hope of a Chriſtian is true, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded upon the promiſes of God, who cannot lie, never deludes the Beleever that liſtens to them.</p>
                  <p>If that of Men be falſe, we need not wonder that it is miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and for thoſe imaginary contentments it allures us with, gives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115672:123"/>but reall pains. For though we may flatteringly apprehend her as the moſt agreeable paſſion, and endeavour to perſwade our ſelves that ſhe ſweetens the diſquietneſſe of our longings; true Philoſophy confeſſeth her the cauſe of our Fear;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deſines ſperare, deſines timere.</hi> Senec.</note> and that the only means to be free from diſtruſtfull apprehenſions, is to be free from hope: But the Hope of a Chriſtian is accompanied with confidence, and ſo cloſe united to pleaſure, that it paſſeth for one part of our Felicity.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the Hope of Worldlings is ſo often faulty, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls it an Abomination, and makes us know, that all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſinners are nothing but Crimes: The Laſcivious promiſeth himſelf nothing but Adulteries, the Ambitious nought but Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the Furious plots vengeance, the Covetous feeds himſelf with unjuſt gains, and all of them ſaith S. <hi>Gregory</hi> never acknowledge their ſin till the pleaſure is paſt, and grief ſucceds in the place thereof: But the Hope of a Chriſtian is Innocent, produceth juſt deſires in their ſouls, and the Good they wait for, makes them commence Saints upon Earth, that they be perfected in heaven.</p>

                  <p>DIvinity teacheth us, that God is ſo infinite, that to expreſſe all his Greatnes, he muſt have as many names as hee hath perfections. Therefore is it that the Scripture calls him ſometimes a Sun, becauſe his brightneſs diſſipates the darkneſs of our hearts, and diſcovers our intentions from the very depth of our wills: Sometimes he is calld a Heaven, becauſe his Immenſity incircles all his works, and comprehends in his Nature, whatever he produceth by his Power: Sometimes hee is ſtiled a devouring Fire, becauſe he conſumes our ſins, and becauſe his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines more active then that Element, burnes the ſouls of the Saints whom it purifieth: Sometimes he is called a Flower, becauſe his beauty raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, his odour perfumes us, and his ſplendour dazels us. In as much as Charity is his nobleſt and moſt excellent expreſſion, the Scripture hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it with the ſame reſpect, and perceiving that it cannot manifeſt all its Excellencies by one ſingle name, gives it as many Appellations, as this Vertue hath different qualities. And becauſe every name is a kind of a Definition, I beleive I ought to rehearſe them in this Diſcourſe,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115672:124"/>which will contribute very much towards the knowledge of the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Charity.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, whom we may call the Diſciple of Love, as well as of Light,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deus charitas eſt &amp; qui manet in charitate in Deo manet, &amp; Deus in eo.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.</note> teacheth us that God is Charity, and though in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition he pretends not to perſwade us that the Charity which makes us love God is God himſelfe, yet his deſign is to inform us, that there is nothing can more happily transform us into God then this vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vouchſafes to bear the name thereof; and of all the things in the world there is none that expreſſe his Greatneſs in ſo noble an Hieroglyphick. Therefore Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> raviſhed with this Speech, hath uttered that which gives us the meaning thereof. God is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, a ſhort Elogie, but exceeding great; ſhort in words, but great in ſenſe: If you inquire how many Gods there are, this Definition will tell you but one, and if you ask what he is, will aſſure you he is Love. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who following the ſteps of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> reviv'd his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in <hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deus Charitas eſt, quid pretio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius? &amp; qui ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net in charitate in Deo manet, quid ſecurius? &amp; Deus in eo, quid jucundius.</hi> Bern.</note> and made us ſee that in the matter of Grace we need conſult no other Oracle, heightens this Definition, with as much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Eloquence. God, ſaith he, is Charity, what more precious? he that abides in Charity, abides in God; what more ſecure? and God abides in him, what condition more agreeable? Indeed we cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe Charity in our hearts, but together with it we muſt have the Divine Eſſence, and their Union is ſo inſeparable, that the one cannot bee loſt without the other.</p>
                  <p>This gave the Apoſtle of the Gentiles occaſion to call Charity the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe being the chiefeſt of his Gifts, he never produceth it in a ſoul but he alwayes enters together with it: Light is never diſ-joyn'd from the Sun; and if it be true that this noble quality ſubſiſted ſome daies without adhering to that glorious Star, the ſame power that united them, may again ſeparate them: But the Holy Spirit and Charity are indiviſible, this fire is never without heat, this Sun is never without brightnes, and all Scripture would be falſe, if Charity were not a certain proof of the preſence of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Apoſtle whom we ſtile the Panegyriſt of Charity, aſſures us, that it is the fulfilling of the Law, and the accompliſhment of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue: Indeed he lives holily, that loves the Supream Good, and at the ſame time thoſe that may enjoy it with him: He is perfect, ſaith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> that can regulate his affection, and govern himſelf with ſo much juſtice, that he loves what is amiable, and hates what is odious; and proportioning his charity to the merit of the objects, loves that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, which he cannot love equally. Therefore is there not ſo great a neceſſity in reading holy Books, in diving into the myſteries of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſearch out the meaning of the Prophets, becauſe in exerciſing Charity we may boaſt we have fullfilled all, we have underſtood all.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115672:124"/>Therefore ſaith the ſame S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſinners have no more excuſe, nor can they lay their ſins upon their ignorance, becauſe God to eaſe their memory ſeems to abbreviate his Doctrine in abbreviating his Word In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and cloathed it with ſo much light, that the moſt Ignorant may underſtand it: It is ſhort, that it may be remembred; cleer that it may bee comprehended; and this treaſure, notwithſtanding its preciouſnes, is ſo eaſie to be diſcovered, that it coſts us no pains to have it, but to ask for it.</p>
                  <p>Let us adde further with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> to explain the nature of a vertue that ſeems inexplicable, that it is the ſource of all good things, <hi>In chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate radicati,</hi> not only becauſe it imparts life but merit and goodnes: For when Hope or Faith are divided from Charity, they die or languiſh; and when Juſtice or Temperance are animated with any other Spirit, they are criminall or unfortunate. I know there are ſome Vertues that ſhare in this glory with Charity; that Faith is called the principle of Chriſtian life, becauſe it is the firſt that God ſheds abroad into mens ſouls, that Humility is the root, becauſe 'tis alwaies hid in the Earth, nor ſhines forth but by thoſe fruits that ſpring from it, but both of them owe their worth to Charity, becauſe without it, the former is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, the ſecond hypocriticall.</p>
                  <p>If leaving the Apoſtles we conſider what the Fathers of the Church have ſpoken of Charity, we ſhall finde all their writings ſo many panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of this vertue, that they are never more eloquent then when they diſcourſe of charity; and looking upon her as the Queen of vertues, ſpeak of her with that reſpect which is due to Soveraigns. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> who hath no leſſe defended the part of Charity, then of Grace, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a thouſand paſſages he is pleaſed to confound them, ſaith, that this excellent vertue is the only Science of Chriſtians, that it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends what ever we know already, and what ever we are yet ignorant of; that it is the principle upon which all other knowledges do depend, and that it imbraceth in her chaſte boſome what ever is ſcattered in the garden of the Scriptures, that it ſhines forth in thoſe myſteries we are acquainted with, and lies hid in thoſe we are yet ignorant of. Thence it comes to paſſe that this great Saint ingaging himſelfe in the proofe of this verity, makes us ſee that Love is the Epitome of all Sciences, and that to be learned is to be charitable. What lights, ſaith he, can we finde in the writings of Philoſophers which we may not diſcover in this Commandment, which obligeth us to love God above all things, and our neighbour as our ſelfe? There you ſhall finde the ſecrets of naturall Philoſophy, becauſe the true cauſes of the Creatures are in God as in their Principle; there you ſhall perceive the precepts of Morality, becauſe we cannot form a good life, but in loving what is amiable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, in loving it as much as is meet: there you ſhall read the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Logick, becauſe the reaſonable ſoul ought not to ſeek,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115672:125"/>nor indeed can finde reaſon and truth any where but in him that is the fruitfull ſource thereof; There you ſhall diſcover the myſteries of the Politicks, becauſe the preſervation of States, and the right conduct of Monarchies depends upon the fair correſpondence and fidelity of the Subjects, who will never love themſelves ſincerely, if they love not the ſupreme Good, God; and if for the love of him, who cannot be deceived, together with him they love not all their like.</p>
                  <p>The Maſter of the Sentences,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Charitas eſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectio qua dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur Deus propter ſe, &amp; proximus prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Deum, vel in Deo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</hi> Senten.</note> who deſerves that name for no other reaſon but becauſe he is the Diſciple of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> walking in his ſteps, that he may not wander, and following his principles, that he may not miſtake, teacheth us that charity is a love as juſt as it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, which weighing the condition of perſons, loves God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his neighbour for Gods ſake: Indeed 'tis a kinde of iniquity to ſeek for motives to love God out of God himſelfe; he ought to be the cauſe of our love; if we reſpect his recompences, rather then his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, we are mercenaries; if we ſtand more in fear of ſtripes then of his frowns, we are ſlaves; and as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, if we are more taken with his gifts, then his goodneſſe, we are adulterers. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it may be holy muſt be chaſte, or to ſpeak more truly, it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to be charity, when it ceaſeth to be chaſte; our love changeth it's nature as ſoon as it changeth it's motive; when it faſtens upon our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, it becomes concupiſcence, and when a man loves God only to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe periſhable goods, or to avoid eternall pains; me thinks he better deſerves the name of Slave, then that of Lover.</p>
                  <p>I am aſham'd that we ſhould deal with God, as we would not be dealt with our ſelves: could we read mens hearts, we ſhould be extreamly offended at the carriage of thoſe friends, who more reſpect our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune then our perſon, and who conſulting only their own intereſts, ſtudy not ſo much our glory, as their own profit. There is no Maſter will keep ſervants who ſerve him only becauſe they cannot impunely offend him, who obey him meerly for fear of the laſh, reſpect not his commands, but becauſe they fear his anger; and certainly he would be well grounded in this reſolution, becauſe there is no body but knowes that a ſlave, who hath no other obligation but his fear, manumits himſelfe as ſoon as he looſeth it, and neglects the ſervice of his Maſter when he hopes for no more recompences, nor ſtands in fear of no more puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>If we believe Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſuch a ſlave hath innocent hands with a guilty heart; Sin lodgeth ſtill in his ſoule with fear; he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not his inclination, but out of the apprehenſion of pain; he loves what he dares not do, and by an infallible conſequence; he hates the Maſter that forbids his undertakings. Therefore doth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is ſo contrary to Concupiſcence, baniſh fear from their ſoules in whom it reſides: It ſeeks the honour of him ſhe
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115672:125"/>loveth, ſacrificeth her Intereſts to the glory of God, and having none but commendable motives, loves him not becauſe he is beneficiall, but becauſe he is indeed amiable: when ſhe communicates her affection by endowments to her neighbour, ſhe looks only upon him whoſe image he is, and not conſidering thoſe reaſons that are the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of intereſſed ſoules, it is enough that a creature is capable of poſſeſſing God to merit a charitable affection. Thence it comes to paſſe that ſhe renders the ſame duties to her enemies; cheriſheth them that injure her; and inſenſible of their wrongs, pardons thoſe that trample upon her. The will of her God ſets all her motions awork; though inordinate nature counſell her, ſhe remains conſtant in her reſolutions, and knowing there is no ſinner whoſe converſion may not be hop'd for; ſhe prayes for thoſe that deſpitefully uſe her, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe may make her tormentors her friends.</p>
                  <p>In as much as this Diſcourſe draws to an end, I muſt be more briefe in the other definitions of Charity, and ſay ſuccinctly with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that ſhe is the love of the true good, becauſe to ſpeak properly, ſhe adheres onely to God, in conſideration of whom ſhe deſpiſeth all other goods, which are nothing but lies or illuſions. The deſire and poſſeſſion whereof ſhe leaves to concupiſcence; ſhe envies not her falſe felicity, becauſe ſhe knows 'tis really but a true miſery; and by means of thoſe lights that came down from heaven, ſhe never troubles her ſelfe to acquire thoſe Goods which make not the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours better, becauſe they cannot uſe them well, if they be not good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they take them in poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>By a neceſſary Conſequence, Charity is a love which makes us tender of thoſe goods wee cannot loſe againſt our wills; I wonder not that Concupiſcence is poore, becauſe the preſervation of her ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches depends not upon her will; ſhee may be rob'd of all that ſhee loves; violence or injuſtice may ſpoil her of her treaſures, calumny may black her reputation, grief may damp her pleaſures, death whoſe only name brings ſo much terrour with it, may take away her life: But Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who hath this advantage that ſhee hath choſen the better part, is well aſſured it ſhall never be taken from her: ſhe loves a Good ſhe cannot be plundred of, ſhe knows that Fortune hath no Dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Grace; that the ſeverity of torments, and the ſweetneſſe of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures cannot impair her felicity. This is it that S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily expreſs'd in thoſe words, which contain the <hi>Encomium</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Charity: <hi>Charitas est amor rerum quas non niſi volentes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittimus:</hi> 'Tis the love of things which we part not with but when we have a mind to it. Inaſmuch as there is great affinity between the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Good and dilection, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath drawn from one and the ſame Principle their common advantage; for he teacheth us, that as
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:115672:126"/>Love is not charitable but when it reſpects a Good which cannot be taken away; the Good alſo is not true, but when he that poſſeſſeth it cannot loſe it but by his own fault.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nolite amare praeſentia, quae poſſeſſa onerant, amata inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, amiſſa cruciant.</hi> Ber.</note> Solid good, ſaith he, is of ſuch a nature, that 'tis never loſt unleſs a man will: The Covetous every day loſe their riches with ſorrow of heart; the Ambitious fall from their dignities with grief of minde; and the immodeſt Wantons teſtifie by their tears, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of what they love is no voluntary loſſe: But this Good, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires us with Goodneſs, can neither be acquired nor loſt without our own conſent.</p>
                  <p>Thence ariſeth another Definition of Charity, and a ſecond oppoſition to Concupiſcence her Enemy: This makes us ſlaves of what we love, finde Servitude where we expect Soveraignty, puniſheth our Ambition in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it; as ſhe imitates the Divel, who ruin'd us by his promiſes, ſhe throws us into thraldom by filling us with the hope of Liberty: There is no ſinner but is ſenſible of his torment. The Covetous are the ſlaves of their wealth; a great Fortune is a glorious ſervitude, and all thoſe that are ingaged in love are intangled in a Captivity. Therefore hath <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaid admirably well; Men become vaſſals of the Creatures, when by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt means they endeavour to make themſelves Maſters. 'Tis Charity onely that exalteth us in humbling us, and more happy then Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence, makes us finde liberty in bondage, ſoveraignty in obedience; for ſubmitting to God, we ſoar above all ſublunary things; by teaching us to obey, we learn to command; and impoſing but one Soveraign over us, gives us as many ſubjects as there are creatures.</p>
                  <p>Finally, to conclude this Diſcourſe with a Definition which may be called the Panegyrick of Charity, we ſay ſhee is the Love of eternall Goods, as Concupiſence is of periſhable ones. This vertue is ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous that after the example of Eagles which look only upon the Sun, ſhee conſiders only God: when ſhee expreſſeth any affection to men or Angels, ſhe riſeth as high as the Creator; ſhe would conceive her ſelf unjuſt, did ſhe love any thing but for God; and making her glory of that Maxime ſhe beſpeaks God by the mouth of one of his Lovers, with theſe excellent words;

                  <head>The Sixth DISCOURSE. <hi>Of the Properties and Effects of Charity.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IF the Learned <hi>Tertullian,</hi> had reaſon to call the Devil Gods Ape; me thinks I may ſtile Concupiſcence the Ape of Charity, becauſe ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to copy her, thereby to obſcure her, promiſing her ſlaves the ſame advantages Charity makes her ſubjects hope for: ſhe takes the ſame courſe, continues the ſame deſigns, and in her oppoſition is ſo perfect a Tranſcript of this excellent Original, that the moſt part of Philoſophers confound them together. Their ends are rather contrary then different; but the means they make uſe of to come thither, are altogether alike; Their Principles are oppoſite, but their Concluſions run parallel; Their thoughts claſh, but their language agrees; ſo that to compleat the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traicture of Charity, I muſt draw the Picture of Concupiſcence, and make uſe of the ſame colours to paint them both.</p>
                  <p>Concupiſcence or ſelf-love is active; the greater it is in the ſource, the more violent is it in the effects; nothing can ſtop its fury, and all the diſorders we ſee in the world, are the works of this irregular paſſion: ſhe changeth her name according to the objects ſhe fixeth upon; and adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to Glory, or Profit, or Pleaſure, ſhe is ſtyled Ambition, Luſt, or Avarice: But in all theſe different conditions, ſhe is ever active, and by no means ſits ſtill. Sometimes ſhe beats an Alarum to war, to increaſe her reputation in enlarging her Empire: Sometimes ſhe paſſeth the Seas to get riches, and driven by want which never forſakes her, feeds her wolfe, ſuppoſing to allay his appetite: Sometimes ſhe ſets upon Chaſtity, and making uſe of a thouſand ſubtilties to corrupt it, troubles whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to purchaſe her ſatisfaction. Therefore is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> who was ſo well acquainted with the humour of Concupiſcence, ſays, that no love was idle; that 'twas active aſſoon as born; that the oppoſitions made againſt it, double its fury; and judging its ſtrength by its violence, finds nothing impoſſible. Thence is it that the ambitious conceive ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deſigns that ſurpaſs humane power, and hardning themſelves againſt all difficulties, had rather break then bow. Thence comes it to paſſe, that the covetous undergoe ſo many miſeries to fill their coffers, and are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fury of all the elements to comply with that paſſion that tyrannizeth over them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe attempts are the images of thoſe Charity effects, which is yet more active then Concupiſcence: For as her hope is founded upon God, and the greatneſs of her Conqueſts heightens her courage, whereby ſhe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115672:127"/>travels for Eternity, ſhe believes there is no pain ſhe ought not to ſuffer, nor difficulties ſhe muſt not overcome. Nothing ſeems hard when it may ſerve her turn, and meaſuring her force by her affection, imagines nothing ought to check her enterpriſes;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nihil difficile videtur amanti: amor enim nome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> difficultatis eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcit.</hi> Bern.</note> She chides her lazineſs when ſhe deliberates: ſhe is afraid her weakneſſe ſhould be objected to her, when ſhe parlies for compoſition; and ſhe is ſo uſed to overcome, that ſhe looks upon difficulties not ſo much as a true excuſe, as a ſhamefull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Thus the Martyrs have traverſed the flames to find Jeſus Chriſt; The Virgins have provoked wild Beaſts, that they might be the ſooner with their Beloved; The <hi>Anchorites</hi> have conteſted with grief, that they might carry Heaven by violence. Finally, Charity is of the nature of fire, ſhe cannot lie ſtill, ſhe ſets upon her body when ſhe finds no other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and that ſhe may not be unprofitable, ſeeks for occaſions of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring when ſhe wants thoſe of acting: And this is the ſecond reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between theſe two Loves.</p>
                  <p>For Concupiſcence hath her Martyrs as well as Charity, ſhe ſuffers for what ſhe loves; and as doing and ſuffering are mutually in the world, ſhe gives proof of her courage in theſe two different conditions: From the evils ſhe undergoes, ſhe extracts vanity; ſhe makes them her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe when they are paſt; and leſt they ſhould ſlip out of her memory, ſhe ruminates upon them in her ſolitudes, and entertains her ſelf with them in companies: ſhe hath ſome ſatisfaction in her Martyrdome, when ſhe thinks it will be an argument of her Conſtancy, or of her Fidelity; nor is ſhe troubled to be made the prey of Flames or of Lions, provided ſhe may evidence her Courage and her Affection. Charity thrives bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in this deſign then Concupiſcence; ſhe hath made many more Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs then vain-glory hath; as ſhe takes her birth from the Croſſe, ſo is ſhe never more vigorous nor content then when ſhe ſwims in her own bloud; ſhe is witty to invent occaſions of ſuffering, and becomes her own tormentor when ſhe can meet with no other. The abſence of her Beloved is the greateſt part of her puniſhment; and conceiving that torments may ſhorten her baniſhment, ſhe is inquiſitive after them, as the remedies of her languiſhing: Therefore doe theſe Divine Lovers ſuffer always upon Earth; the peace of the Church frees not them from perſecution; and though the Princes that govern them are Chriſtians, they meet with Tyrants that perſecute them. Every failing is their torture; every moment makes them languiſh, and they die a thouſand times in a day, becauſe they will not die at laſt. Indeed their Love which is as witty as cruel, learns them innocent murders; they commit Parricides without a Crime; they kill <hi>Adam</hi> in their perſon, that Jeſus Chriſt may live there; they take vengeance of this Father that made them guilty, and deſtroying whatever they received from him; of every one of their inclinations they make a reaſonable ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But the Maſter-piece of Love is, that it makes that preſent which we
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:115672:127"/>love, and in deſpight of abſence unites us with it. Remoteneſs is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the greateſt torments of Love; he ſhuns it as his mortalleſt enemy, and employs all his ſtratagems to be ſecured from it: he hath recourſe to Preſents, knowing very well that they are the remembrancers of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and that 'tis very hard to forget a perſon to whom we are beholding: he entertains himſelf by the commerce of Letters; he writes to thoſe he cannot ſpeak to; he beguiles his Paſſion with a picture; and not being able to ſee his friend, he is ſatisfied with beholding his portraicture: But when all theſe inventions content not, he reflects upon himſelf; and making uſe of his thoughts and deſires, he goes upon the queſt, and retrives him whoſe abſence cauſed his puniſhment. For the Underſtanding is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious faculty, which by a Natural Magick renders abſent things preſent; excelling the Imagery of Painters, becauſe her Idea's can ſpeak; and the ſame ſpirit that gives them life, infuſes motion into them, and ſpeech: If Love be not ſatisfied with this invention, he obligeth the Will to enquire out what ſhe affecteth; and to quit the body and the ſoul, to be united to the object of her ſorrow. To obey her Soveraign, ſhe commands her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to beſtir themſelves, to prevent the diligence of the windes; and paſſeth Sea and Land to ſeek the Subject of her vexation to the worlds end: She purſues the Poſts ſhe hath diſpatched; imitates the agility of Angels; and like thoſe ſpirits finding themſelves wherever they operate, clings in ſpight of abſence to what ſhe loveth. In theſe admirable courſes, ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at her journeys end without paſſing any middle diſtance; ſhe traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Kingdoms in a moment; and diſengaging her ſelf from the body ſhe informs, findes her ſelf miraculouſly in the ſubject ſhe loves.</p>
                  <p>Concupiſcence works the ſame Miracles every day; ſhe makes uſe of the Underſtanding and of the Will for her ſatisfaction; ſhe employs theſe two faculties to content her Paſſion; and when the ears or the eyes can tell her no news of the remote objects that torment her, ſhe hath recourſe to her thoughts and deſire to bring them to her preſence. But we muſt confeſs that Charity acts this part much better; for though that which ſhe loves be in heaven, ſhe journeys thither without wearineſs; ſhe goes to ſeek him whom the Angels enjoy;

For S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> excellently informs me, our Affections are our Wings, and our Will is our Guide to conduct us to heaven. You think perhaps you muſt build a tower to aſcend thither; that the Angels muſt be invited down to aſſiſt you, or that the wings of a dove muſt be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to convey you thither: but your Love is your Pole-ſtar; by your Deſires you ſcale thoſe heavenly regions; by your negligence you ſtand at diſtance from them; and loving God upon the earth, you may boaſt your ſelves already in heaven: For it is not with the Soul as with the Body; this cannot move without changing of place; but that needs onely change her affection, and preſently ſhe aſcends: ſhe is where ſhe would be; her
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115672:128"/>love makes all her objects preſent; and aſſoon as over ſhe ſixeth her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon any thing, 'tis no longer at a diſtance: This is it which he delivers admirably in another paſſage: We can never be better then when we are with him whom nothing can equal in goodneſs; we go thither not walking, but loving; and he is ſo much the neerer and at hand, by how much our Love is more pure and vigorous. Then letting us ſee the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Charity hath above Concupiſcence, he brings in God ſpeaking theſe words which evidence an Oracle: I command you to love me; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that in doing ſo, you ſhall enjoy me: Sinners poſſeſs not all that they love; there are covetous worldlings that ſigh for gold, and yet are poor; Ambitious perſons that are paſſionate for glory, and yet are infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous: but every one that loves me, findes me; I am with him that ſeeks for me; his love makes me preſent in his ſoul; aſſoon as he longs for me, I am in his embraces; and I leave off to be abſent aſſoon as he begins to be in love with me.</p>
                  <p>Though there is not any lover that hath ſpoken more nobly of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of God in our ſouls by Charity then S. <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> the Fathers his followers have uſed the ſame language; and once inſtructed in the School of Divine Love, have acknowledged that 'twas impoſſible to love God and not to poſſeſs him.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui mente inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra Deum deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat, profecto jam habet quem amat; neque enim quiſquam poſſet Deum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere, ſi hunc quem diligit non haberet.</hi> Greg. mag. in Moral.</note> See what S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith in his Morals, which differs little from what S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath delivered in his Confeſſions. The Believer that ſeeks after God without dividing his affections, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him already whom his ſoul loveth: For he could never be amorous for him, were he not filled with his love, and inanimated with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> who ſerves for an Interpreter to the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> and expreſſeth her minde with as much innocent nakedneſs as winning ſweetneſs, brings her in holding the ſame diſcourſe. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts her ſelf in the abſence of her Beloved, by the belief ſhe hath that ſhe bears him in her heart, and that ſhe is the living throne of him who never forſakes her but to exerciſe her patience.</p>
                  <p>Let us conclude this Diſcourſe with the higheſt operation of Love, and ſay, that this laſt effect is to transform Lovers into the things that they love, and to ſtamp them with their qualities. This proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is ſo natural to Love, that it remains with it even when it exerciſeth its power over inanimate things. If the Elements jar, if they trouble the peace of the Univerſe by their conteſtations; if theſe four bodies that compoſe all others, ſeem to engage whole Nature in their quarrels; 'tis Love that obligeth them to the combat: and when Fire and Water diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the boſome of the clouds, or in the bowels of the earth, they have no other deſigne but to transform each other. Love hath a greater ſhare in their difference then Ambition; neither do they ſtrive ſo much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy one another as to be united, that they may be but one and the ſame thing. Concupiſcence ſucceeds wonderfully in this enterpriſe; ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints in men all the qualities of thoſe objects ſhe obligeth them to be in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115672:128"/>love with; and by a ſtrange Metamorphoſis, deprives them of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per inclinations, to indue them with ſtrange external ones: They become abominable as the things that they doat upon; they change their Nature, in changing their Love: and we ſee by experience, that Laſcivious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons become effeminate as the women they careſs, that the Ambitious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the vanity of that glory they court, and the Covetous become as ſenſleſs as the metal they adore.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Similes eis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant qui ſaciuns ea, &amp; omnes qui confidunt in eis.</hi> Pſal. 115.</note> Therefore <hi>David</hi> juſtly wiſhed that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, following the laws of Love, might become like their Idols, and might loſe ſpeech and motion for their love towards dumb and ſenſleſs gods, that the Iſraelites might more eaſily defeat them in the combat.</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as Concupiſcence plays the deceiver, ſhe makes good but half her promiſes to her ſervants: For ſhe transforms them onely to their loſs; ſhe changeth them meerly to make them miſerable; and of all the qualities the things they love are indued with, ſhe communicates none to them for the moſt part but bad ones: The Luſtful, who contract the lightneſs of women, gain not their beauty: The Covetous, who grow ſtupid as their metal, extract not its value: and the Ambitious, who va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour like the glory they feed upon, become not always Soveraigns.</p>
                  <p>But Charity, which is more ſincere and more powerful then Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, happily transforms Chriſtians into what they love: ſhe imprints upon them the qualities of heaven, and makes them heavenly upon earth; by different degrees it exalts them as high as Divinity it ſelf; ſhe gives them what the devil promiſed their firſt father; ſhe changeth them into Gods by a holy Metamorphoſis, and makes them innocently obtain what Pride made them heretofore inſolently covet: For Mans moſt ancient paſſion is to be like God: this was his crime and his deſire in Paradiſe; 'twas upon this conſideration that he liſtned to the devil; and under this hope he violated the command of God. His Pride was puniſhed with an ignominious brand; and he that pretended to an equality with his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, ſaw himſelf reduced to the condition of his meaneſt Subjects: This correction made him not forget his deſire; he preſerved his arrogance in the midſt of his miſery; and being but the relique of innocent man, he could not forbear to wiſh to be a God.</p>
                  <p>Piety hath taught him an honeſt means to content his ambition: Grace takes pains to aſſimilate him according to his deſire: the Vertues are ſo many draughts compleating this Image; but Charity, their Queen, gives it perfection: She it is that ſatisfies his longings; and raiſing him above himſelf, happily transforms him into God: This is the end of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of this auguſt Vertue, the Maſter-piece of her power, the triumph of her glory; and when ſhe hath brought Man to this height of felicity, ſhe is content, becauſe he is happie: Let us not advance ſo important a Vertue without caution; let us make it appear that he who was ſo well acquainted with the nature of Love, was not ignorant of his effects: Let us make uſe of the words of S. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Men, ſaith he, take their name
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115672:129"/>from what they love; they owe their condition to their affection; as wives take the quality of their husbands, and Lovers thoſe of their Miſtreſſes: ſo in loving the earth, they become earthly; in loving heaven, they become heavenly; and carrying their affection higher in loving God, they become Divine. But there needs no other proof of this verity, but the Myſtery of the Incarnation, where Love triumphing over God himſelf, made him aſſume the form of a Man, inveſted him with our nature and our miſeries, loaded him with our ſins, and obliged him to appear before his Father as a Penitent, or rather as an Anathema. This prodigious change makes us look for another: For God was not made Man, but that Men might be made Gods; he was humbled, that they might be exalted; he took their nature, that he might beſtow his upon them; nor did he ſuffer his love to render him like Man, but to perſwade them that the ſame love may liken them to God.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115672:129"/>Prudence of the Heathen is blind and intereſſed; that their Fortitude is upheld meerely by Vanity; that their Temperance overcomes one paſſion with another; and that their Juſtice being arrogant, ſeeks only fair pretences to authoriſe its uſurpations: So that theſe Vertues have not recovered their Primitive purity, but by the grace of Chriſtianity. They owe all their worth to Charity; they are acceptable to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they proceed from Jeſus Chriſt; nor can they hope for an eternal recompence, but becauſe they have a Supernatural and Divine Principle: Therefore the ſame Doctor mingles Charity always in the definition of theſe Vertues,

In this conceit he cals Prudence an illuminated Love, Juſtice a regulated Love, Fortitude a couragious Love, and Temperance a faithful Love.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this definition ſeems to limit theſe Vertues, and many think they are not ſo much the Impulſes as the Miniſters of Love; Let us ſay, that Prudence is a Practicall Science, teaching the ſoul what it ought to doe, inſpiring her with a love of good things, and a deteſtation of bad; and carrying light into the underſtanding, teacheth it to diſcern what is profitable from what is hurtful.</p>
                  <p>Fortitude is a couragious Vertue, making us ſuffer with an evenneſſe of mind affronts and griefs; 'Tis a victorious habit that triumphs in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and owes the beſt part of her advantages to the bitterneſſe of the afflictions that perſecute her: 'Tis a ſtability of ſpirit againſt all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the world; a reſolution to fight and overcome all the labours that accompany life; 'Tis a Vertue whoſe generous humour makes us deſire great things, contemn low things, and endure hard things; or it is a Vertue that raiſeth the ſoul above Fear, apprehending nothing but diſhonour, and which inſtructs us to carry our ſelves equally in favours, and in diſgraces; If we will ſhut her up within the bounds of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we may ſay, it is a Vertue inform'd with Grace, preparing us to undergo all things rather then fail of our duty.</p>
                  <p>Temperance is a juſt dominion of reaſon over the paſſions, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially over thoſe that flatter us by the pleaſure they promiſe, and employ voluptuouſneſſe to ſeduce us: 'Tis a Vertue that teacheth us to wiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may cauſe ſhame in us or regret; not to doe any thing that exceeds the bounds of reaſon; to ſuffer nothing that may diminiſh her authority, and foment the rebellion of her lawful ſubjects: Or to uſe Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> expreſſions, 'tis an affection that ſubdueth the Concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble appetite, and gives it not leave to hunt after thoſe pleaſures which are accompanied with ſhame or followed wich repentance.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice is a Vertue that prefers the publick intereſts before private; and many times puniſheth a Delinquent with more ſeverity then his fault requires, to ſtop the courſe of evil, and to aſtoniſh other offenders. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> it is a Vertue which hath more
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115672:130"/>reſpect to the ſervice of others, then of it ſelf; and conſiders more the advantages of her neighbour, then her own. According to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it renders every one their due, puniſheth Vice, rewards Vertue, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the peace of the State by the ſeverity of puniſhments, and the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of recompences; Let us adde with <hi>Seneca,</hi> though very blind in the knowledge of Chriſtian Vertues, that Juſtice is a ſecret Convention Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath contracted with men for the ſuccour of the innocent or diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; that it is a Divine Law that entertains humane ſociety, preſerves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man his right, and not reſpecting the quality of the perſons, conſiders only their merits. Finally, 'tis a Chriſtian Vertue, which enlightned by Faith, animated with Charity, obligeth man to ſatisfie at once God, himſelf, and his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>Having examined the nature of theſe Vertues, it remains that we take notice of their uſe, and the profit that ariſeth from them. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> whom in Morality I look upon as my Guide, and in Divinity my Maſter, ſaith, that theſe Vertues are given to the ſoul to imbelliſh her, and to arm her againſt Vices. Prudence teacheth her what ſhe is to doe, is in ſtead of a Torch to light her in the darkneſſe of the world. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance learns her not to bee charmed with pleaſure; Fortitude not to be vanquiſhed with griefs; and Juſtice not to be tranſported with her own intereſts: or to expreſſe another way, no leſſe ſolidly, and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly, the obligations of theſe Vertues, it concerns Prudence to know our power, Fortitude to employ it, Temperance to moderate it, Juſtice to rule it; and as this Divine Spirit can never be exhauſted, but knows how to give a hundred colours to the ſame thing, thereby to diſcover all the different beauties thereof; Let us adde with him, that Prudence concerns the choice of means: Temperance the uſe of pleaſures: Fortitude that of afflictions, and Juſtice the diſtribution of all theſe. Finally, he concludes that it belongs to Prudence to foreſee hidden things, to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance to deſie pleaſures, to Fortitude to attaque them, and to Juſtice to regulate their intereſts.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe duties ſavour ſtill of the deſcription, let us ſpeak of thoſe that denote the neceſſity of theſe Vertues, and ſay, that hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty which is inſeparable from them is compoſed of four parts, without which it cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt; The firſt is Knowledge, which ſerves it for a conduct and a light; The ſecond is the Intereſt of Society, which ought always to be preferred before that of particulars; The third is a certain magnanimity, which ſeems as it were the ſoul of all honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Actions, and the defence of all Vertues; The fourth is Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which keeps every one within his duty, not ſuffering him to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing that may be diſadvantageous to his neighbour. Light appertains to Prudence; the care of the Community to Juſtice; Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſes to Fortitude, and the regulating of Pleaſures to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:115672:130"/>
                  <p>Therefore hath that excellent Copier of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> who being able to be a great Maſter of his own Head, choſe rather to be an humble Diſciple of that learned Doctor; obſerved, that the Vertues coming in to the help of man a ſinner, ſeemed to have a mind to cure four great wounds which Original ſin had inflicted upon him.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is Ignorance, which is born with him, which involves him in darkneſſe aſſoon as ever nature expoſeth him to the light; For he is Ignorant aſſoon as Criminal, and as Grace is neceſſary to deliver him from ſin, Prudence is requiſite to defend him from Errour and Falſhood; ſhe irradiates his mind with a Heavenly Light, gives him the ſpirit of diſcerning between Good and Evil, and ſevering apparent good from reall, keeps him from wandering in the courſe of his life.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond wound is that of Concupiſcence, which ſeems particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to have ſet upon the Concupiſicible appetite, which ſhe hath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the love of ſinful ſenſualities, and diverts from innocent content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; againſt this agreeable enemy, Heaven hath given him Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, whoſe buſineſſe 'tis to undeceive this irregular appetite, to make uſe of charms to ſuppreſſe his unjuſt inclinations, and to reduce him to a condition, where he wiſheth only reaſonable things.</p>
                  <p>The third wound is Weakneſs, which plungeth man in idleneſs, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him not to act, frights him from Vertue, becauſe of the difficulties 'tis accompanied with, and repreſenting Death as a <hi>Spectrum,</hi> Grief as a Monſter, ſtrives to deter him from his duty by ſuch fearful apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: againſt this great inconvenience, which may be called the root of all other; Fortitude ſtands up which heightens our courage, fils the man with hope and activity, animates him with glory, the companion of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and changing our diſeaſes into remedies, makes us find honour in pain, and Immortality in Death.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and deepeſt wound is the malice of the will, which may be called a Natural Injuſtice, which is troubled at the proſperity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth at the adverſity of his neighbour: when a man minds nothing but his own intereſts, believes whatever is profitable is lawful, placeth right in force, duty in pleaſure, and is perſwaded that glory being inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from profit, there is nothing beneficial which at the ſame time is not honourable. Morality to rid him of ſo Potent an enemy, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him Juſtice, which ſupplying the loſs of Original righteouſneſs, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to prefer his duty before his intereſt, and his conſcience before his reputation. This excellent Vertue which is the ſoule of all the reſt, undertakes to regulate mans actions, to appeaſe all diſorders wherein his guilty birth hath engaged him; For ſhe ſubmitteth his mind to God, his body to his mind, and having made this double agreement, tries to accommodate man with his neighbour, and to eſtabliſh peace in his ſtate after ſhe hath brought it into his perſon.</p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:115672:131"/>
                  <p>Nothing diſtinguiſheth this Vertue from Original righteouſneſs, but the reſiſtence it meets with in thoſe things it would regulate; for the firſt took no pains to be obeyed, ſhe had to doe with tractable ſubjects; the ſoul and body had not as yet claſh'd; their inclinations though diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, were not oppoſite; and theſe two parts that make up man, were not contrary in their deſigns: ſo that Original righteouſneſs had no hard task to manage a peace, which ſeemed founded as well in Grace as in Nature; But Chriſtian Juſtice meets with inſolent ſubjects, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not their Soveraign, obey her not but by compulſion; who being born in ſedition, think it their duty to live in diſobedience; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, when aſſiſted with Prudence to chuſe means of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſeconded with Temperance, to ſuppreſs pleaſures; and manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported by Fortitude, to overcome grief; ſhe gains that by violence, which Original righteouſneſs did by ſweet compliance; and if ſhe be not ſo quiet, ſhe may boaſt at leaſt ſhe is more glorious.</p>
                  <p>To expreſs the ſame Truth in other words, and to give it a new beauty in ſetting it out in new colours, we may ſay, that Prudence is buſied in diſcuſſing thoſe things that deceive us, to diſcern truth from falſhood, and to ſecure us from being ſurpriſed with a lye: Temperance is employed to ſuppreſs thoſe things that charm our affections, and whoſe allurements pleaſingly heighten our appetites: Fortitude is engaged to vanquiſh thoſe things that terrifie us; it revives our ſpirits; and as a General of an Army that heartens his ſoldiers, endeavours to rally that Courage Grief or Danger had in a manner routed. Juſtice is buſied in regulating thoſe concernments wherein lies our intereſt, and which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a colour of ſome gain, would ſet us upon ſome violent courſe to compaſs it. Wherefore <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, that perillous things were to be maſtered by Valour; pleaſurable things to be moderated by Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; Things that abuſe us to be examined by Prudence; and thoſe that tempt, and fain would corrupt us, to be regulated by Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>If it be true that Vertue reſpects only our perſon, and that, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of ſome Philoſophers, who would make her the ſlave of our intereſts, her ſole object is man; we may ſay, without thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their conceit, that Prudence conſiders things without us, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hid and obſcured by the diſtance of places and times, cannot be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen but by the light of this Vertue, which ſeems to be a natural kind of propheſie: According to this principle, Temperance regulates things that are below us in the inferiour Region of the ſoul, reduceth the paſſions and the ſenſes to their duty, and entertains reaſon in her Empire: Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude combats thoſe things that riſe againſt us, defends us from our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſcatters all thoſe evils whoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pomps hath no other deſign but to weaken our courage: Juſtice looks after that which is beſide or above us, makes us render to God our Soveraign, and to our neighbour our equal, what of due belongs unto them: and parting our obligations according
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115672:131"/>to their conditions, bindes us to love the former above our ſelves, and the later as our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>If, as it is very likely, theſe Vertues reſpect our reſt and quietneſs; they deliver us from four inconveniences which may exceedingly trouble us: For many times we prefer an imaginary apparent Good before a real one; and from this errour Prudence ſecures us: we deſert a Good, becauſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult; and from this cowardiſe Fortitude rouzeth us: we ſeek after ſome pleaſing, but unprofitable or pernicious Good; and this pitfal Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance teacheth us to avoid: or, laſtly, we deſire ſomething advantageous to our ſelves, but prejudicial to our neighbour; and this iniquity Juſtice forbids, obliging us to preſerve the intereſt of another as our own.</p>
                  <p>But whatever ſuccour the Chriſtian can draw from theſe vertues, he muſt confeſs they reproach him with his miſeries, and exprobate him with his crimes: For Prudence informs him that he is in baniſhment, where Good and Evil are mixt together, and where he is in danger to miſtake as often as he hath occaſion to chuſe. Temperance teacheth him that he hath inordinate Paſſions that muſt be ſuppreſt, that he nouriſheth monſters in his perſon which muſt be ſtrangled; but that the diſeaſe over-tops the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, becauſe Prudence diſſipates not the darkneſs of his Ignorance, nor doth Temperance regulate all the diſorders of his Appetite. Juſtice tells him he muſt ſubmit his ſpirit to God, his body to his ſpirit; but the reſiſtance he findes, makes him ſadly feel that earth is not the manſion of Peace, nor this life the time of Triumph. Finally, Fortitude, which obligeth him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat Grief, is an argument that he is ſtill criminal, becauſe he ſtill remains miſerable.</p>

                  <head>The Eighth DISCOURSE. <hi>Of the Humility of a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is a ſtrange thing, but withal exceeding true, that of all the Vertues there is none more natural, nor yet a greater ſtranger to Man then Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: For ſhe is born with him; he carries the principles thereof in his ſoul and in his body, in that the one is drawn out of Nothing, the other is formed out of the Slime of the earth: He muſt forget his extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to give the leaſt admittance to Vain-glory; and he need onely ſtudy and minde himſelf, to be ſenſibly affected with Humility. Therefore ſaid an Ancient that Pride was a ſtranger-vice, and Humility a natural vertue. In the mean time, Man was never more arrogant then ſince he became ſo wretchedly miſerable: That which ought to take down his ſpirit, hath raiſed it; and the miſery that ſhould have taught him Humility, hath made him quite forget ſo commendable a vertue. She was unknown to the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115672:132"/>Heathen: her name, which we account ſo glorious, was infamous among them; nor was it ever aſcribed to any actions but thoſe that deſerved blame. It was neceſſary that Chriſtian grace ſhould revive her, and that her light ſhould diſcover the beauties of this unknown vertue: Indeed ſhe had no credit with men, till the myſtery of the Incarnation: God muſt be abaſed, that we may learn this leſſon; and his examples muſt perſwade humane wilfulneſs that true greatneſs conſiſts in lowe deportment.</p>
                  <p>Though this Vertue takes her merit from her Maſter, and her glory is very remarkable in having God for her Author; yet muſt we confeſs that in her own nature ſhe is of very high eſteem, and that her proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal excellency gives worth and value to her. For ſhe ſeems to include all the Cardinal vertues, and to comprehend all their advantages in her eſſence: She partakes of Prudence, becauſe ſhe is illuminated, and knows the greatneſs of God and the meanneſs of the Creature: She hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Temperance, becauſe ſhe bridles the pleaſure that vanity promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and defends her ſelf from that agreeable enemy, who makes uſe of praiſes onely to deceive us: She ſhares with Fortitude, becauſe ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats ſhame and grief, which frequently accompany baſe and unworthy actions: Finally, ſhe is an image of Juſtice, becauſe ſhe treats the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and the Creature with ſo much equity; and rendering Glory to the one, reſerves nothing but Contempt for the other.</p>
                  <p>But leſt we ſhould think her riches are meerly the ſpoils of another, that ſhe hath none but borrowed excellencies, nor is at all conſiderable but for the alms ſhe receives from other vertues; we ſhall do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her nature, and to be acquainted with her by weighing her definition. Humility, according to S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is a voluntary debaſement of the ſoul before God, in the ſight of her own condition; which repreſenting her Nothingneſs, reads her this leſſon, that none can preſerve her but he that created her: This great man expreſly joyns the Creature with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in this definition: for Man looking onely upon himſelf, might eaſily grow proud at the ſight of his own priviledges: when he looks up to God, compares the Creature with the Creator, confronting two things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite by ſuch an infinite diſtance, he is obliged to fall lowe upon his face, if his Pride exceed not that of the devil. Therefore did that afflicted Prince, who would perſwade his friends that his being miſerable was no argument he was criminal, change his language, when he had compared his own defects with the perfections of God, and confeſs there was no creature ſo holy that was not guilty before him: <hi>Now mine eye ſeeth thee, and therefore I abhor my ſelf:</hi> As if he would have ſaid, Whilſt I compared my actions with thoſe of men, I cheriſhed a high opinion of my vertue; but when thy light had cleared my ſpirit, and I beheld that holineſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou art ſo gloriouſly ſeparated from thy works, I prevent thy arreſt; and forgetting my innocence, paſs ſentence of condemnation upon my ſelf. This is the apprehenſion of Humility; and whenever Man is tempted to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:115672:132"/>Pride, this lowlineſs of minde preſents him before God in his nature, in his perſon, in his actions: in his Nature, that he is miſerable; in his Perſon, that he is criminal; in his Actions, that he is unconſtant and wavering.</p>
                  <p>Others define Humility a diſeſteem that Man conceives of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, inaſmuch as he hath not any thing which was not given him by Grace, and may not be taken away by Juſtice. For this wretch lives but upon loan: In the height of his Innocence, he was but many creatures in groſs; and it ſeems that God, to oblige him to Humility, made him up of borrowed pieces: He takes his Being from the Elements, his Life from Plants, his Senſe from Animals, and his Underſtanding from Angels: So that ſhould he return every Creature what he hath received, all that would remain to him would be his Nothingneſs and his Sin.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> whom we may call the Panegyriſt of Humility, knowing that this vertue hath two Principles, the Minde and the Will, defines it ſometimes a knowledge of our miſeries, ſometimes a contempt of our advantages: Both theſe definitions are true; but the ſecond is much more perfect then the former: For the very devils, in the midſt of their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, acknowledge their miſeries; they are not ignorant that he that puniſheth them is able to deſtroy them; and that notwithſtanding their rebellion, they depend upon this juſt Soveraign whom they have diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. But there are none but the Righteous that joyn Submiſſion to their Knowledge, and, by an act of the Will,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Humilitas eſt contemptus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priae excellentiae.</hi> Bernard.</note> paſs from the ſight of their infirmities to the contempt of their perfections: They would not change their nature nor their condition; they rejoyce that their Being makes them the ſervants of God: of a happie Neceſſity, they make an excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; and profiting by their Miſery, they grow great by diminution. For Glory is the portion of Humility; ſhe cannot ſhun that honour ſhe flies from; this enemy ſhe apprehends leaves her not but for a time; and that which ſeems to threaten her ruine, becomes at laſt her recompence.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as Pride and Humillty are oppoſite in their nature, they are alſo contrary in their effects: Pride intending to exalt it ſelf, is thrown down; the more it approacheth to God, the more it removeth from him; and by a misfortune inevitably accompanying this capital ſin, it tumbles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hell, when it thinks to ſcale heaven: But Humility, which walks ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther path, is exalted in being abaſed, draws neer to God by ſtanding at a diſtance from him, and reacheth heaven by deſcending to the gates of hell. Therefore doth her enemy dreſs himſelf ſometimes in her mantle, to carry on his deſignes; he affects modeſty, and, to gain reputation, ſeems to ſlight it: but his diſſimulation is of no continuance; his vanity preſently betrays him; and upon the firſt battery made againſt his honour, he is tranſported with invectives, which diſcover the ſtately humour he fain would have concealed.</p>
                  <p>In this oppoſition of Pride and Humility, they have notwithſtanding ſome correſpondence: For as Humility preſerves all the Vertues, Pride
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115672:133"/>animates all the Vices: He excites Envie, which is nothing but a ſadneſs at the proſperity of another: He whets Vengeance, which is armed onely to deſtory whatever reſiſts it: He awakens Calumny, which ſets upon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue but becauſe ſhe darkens his glory: and this Monſter which produceth all ſins by his activity, protects them by his malice. Humility, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is the Guardian of all Vertues: if ſhe gives them not their life, ſhe preſerves it; if ſhe be not their Mother, ſhe is their Nurſe; and if ſhe be not pompous enough to ſerve them for an ornament, ſhe is courageous enough to ſerve them for a defence. It is S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> that beſtows this Elogie upon her, and calls her the Protectreſs of the Vertues, becauſe they are expoſed to Vanity aſſoon as ever they are left deſtitute of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that 'tis a kinde of miracle, when, having loſt this ſupport, they can for any time defend themſelves from their enemies. S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſets a higher price upon it then S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and will have the Vertues no longer acceptable to God then they are humble: nay, he goes further, that the Purity of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> had never procured her the quality of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mother of God, had ſhe not been accompanied with Humility.</p>
                  <p>Seeing this Vertue is ſo neceſſary, the reſt of this Diſcourſe ſhall be ſpent in the ſearch of ſome Reaſons which may as motives beget it in our ſouls, and convince our Judgements, that ſo our Wills may incline towards it. I finde that this Vertue hath three Principles abſolutely incompatible with Pride. The firſt is <hi>Nothing:</hi> the ſecond is <hi>Sin:</hi> the third is <hi>Death. Nothing</hi> is the Glory of God, and the Shame of Man; 'tis the Theatre upon which the Divine Majeſtie acts moſt nobly, the Womb whereout he extracts all his works of Creation, the moſt obedient of all his ſubjects, and which acknowledgeth none but his Orders. Nature cannot create any thing; and though ſhe be ſo powerful, her operations are rather changes then productions. She converts the dew into flowers and fruits, turns the vapours into clouds, diſſolves them into ſhowers, inflames them into lightnings, or makes them rattle in thunder: She is abſolute when ſhe acts upon the Elements; and having altered their qualities, converts them into their contraries: But notwithſtanding all her power, ſhe cannot act upon Nothing: and, as if ſhe knew him for her father, ſhe bears him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and by no means dares venture to command him. Art, which is the Ape of Nature, never makes her induſtry admired but in alterations: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt ſuſtain her; and there muſt be ſome matter whereon to exerciſe her power. Painters can draw no Pictures without Colours, Architects raiſe no buildings without materials; and if you take away Marble or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry from Engravers, they can carve neither Images nor Statues: It is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God that actuates Nothing, who forms a Being out of a Non-entity, and makes his Omnipotence manifeſt in commanding this Rebel.</p>
                  <p>As it is the Theatre of his Glory, ſo is it the ſubject of our Confuſion: 'Tis enough to abaſe the ſtouteſt, but to think that Nothing is his original, that an eternity of ages paſſed before he was in Nature, and that he could
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115672:133"/>not come forth of that abyſſe of darkneſs and miſery. In this dreadful habitation the Angel hath no priviledge above the Beaſt; all things are more confuſed then in the fabulous Chaos; and in this undigeſted med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, the nobleſt creature hath no mark of ſeparation from the moſt vile. But that which addes much to mans humiliation, is, that he hath a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral bent towards annihilation; the power that redeemed him from it, muſt ſtill preſerve him from relapſing; He is divided by two contrary Inclinations; he removes from Nothingneſs, as from the place of his loſs; he approacheth inſenſibly towards it, as the place of his Original; and the experience he daily meets with of his infirmity, confirms him in the truth of this belief. All creatures would ceaſe to be, ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> did God withdraw his arm that ſuſtains them:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si potentiam ſuam fabricato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam rebus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahat, ita non erunt ſicut antequam fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent non fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> Aug.</note> and did he leave off to uphold them, they would leave off to ſubſiſt; did he not keep them by his looks, they would vaniſh into air; and did he not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate himſelf in his creatures, they would have the ſame deſtiny with the ſhadows in a glaſſe; which depend ſo abſolutely upon our preſence, that they would periſh, did we but turn away our face from beholding them. This is it perhaps that the Prophet intended in thoſe words which he addreſſeth to God in behalf of the creature, <hi>Avertente autem te faciem turbabuntur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond Principle of Humility is ſin, which is a Non-Entity in the order of Grace, and which abaſeth the ſinner to ſo low a condition, that he is much more miſerable then if he were annihilated. For inaſmuch as he recedes from God the ſupream Beeing, adhering to the creature, who is in a manner Nothing, himſelf becomes a wretched Non-Entity, and loſeth all thoſe advantages he was made partaker of by the union he had with his Creator.

Therefore doth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in ſome place of his writings call ſin an armed Nothing; and the Scripture to ſhew us the horrour goes along with it,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nihil rebelle &amp; in Deum armatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Amb.</note> prefers the condition of men who never were, before that of tranſgreſſors who are fallen into ſin.</p>
                  <p>The third Principle of Humility is Death, which ſeems the middle between Nothing and Sin: It is an image of the former, and a chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſecond; it bears the name of both in Scripture; and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets illuminated from above, call it ſometimes a Nothing, ſometimes a
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115672:134"/>Sin. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives us a handſome proof hereof in theſe words: Death, ſaith he, is the puniſhment of ſin; he bears the name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to teach us that though man ſin not in dying, he never ſhould have died if he had not ſinned: and the ſame Doctor in another paſſage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints us that Death is a Nothing, which having no Eſſence, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be ordained by the Juſtice of God, but not produced by his Power. Thence it comes to paſſe that 'tis a ſhameful puniſhment attempting the honor of man and his life, and makes him feel himſelf a Criminal, becauſe having ſet upon his reputation, it proceeds to attaque his perſon: For he deſtroys this Maſter-piece of Nature, ſeparates the two parts that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him, breaks the ligaments that unites them, and being not able to be revenged upon the ſoul, diſchargeth his fury upon the body, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts the Miſtreſs in puniſhing her ſervant.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould not all theſe powerful conſiderations oblige man to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf, the Chriſtian could by no means refuſe this homage, when he conſiders that his ſalvation depends upon Grace; that his Liberty without this Supernatural aid, ſerves only to damn him; and being fallen from that happy condition wherein he was the maſter of his fortune, he is now the ſlave of Concupiſcence if he be not enfranchiſed by the merits of Jeſus Chriſt. Indeed the Example of God debaſed, greatly comforts him in his miſery; he is never troubled to humble himſelf; when he conſiders the Word annihilated in the Incarnation, he ſubmits to the Counſels of that Divine Maſter; he is not aſhamed to learn humility in his School; and having heard that Oracle from his mouth, <hi>Diſcite à me quia mitis ſum &amp; humilis corde:</hi> he looks upon this Vertue as his Glory, and is forced to confeſs with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that if it be a Prodigy to behold a man proud, 'tis a Miracle to ſee a God humbled; and by conſequence of ſo great an Example, that man muſt have loſt his judgement that ſhould be aſhamed of Humility.</p>

                  <head>The Ninth DISCOURSE. <hi>Of the Repentance of a Chriſtian.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>ALL the Vertues have their particular advantages: the leaſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did are the moſt uſeful, and thoſe that have not ſo many allurements have commonly moſt deſert; Repentance is of the number of theſe, and it ſeems 'tis not ſo much her beauty, as her neceſſity, that makes her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable; Her Countenance hath no comelineſs; her Mouth is always full of ſighes; her Eyes moiſt with tears; her ſhoulders covered with ſackcloth, and her hands armed with diſcipline. The Intereſt of God
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115672:134"/>ſets her againſt her ſelf; his Goodneſs offended, his Glory obſcured, his Mercy neglected, provokes her indignation againſt ſinners, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them to invent torments to puniſh their offences.</p>
                  <p>But did not her zeal contribute to her excellency, ſhe is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that in whatever condition man appears, ſhe is proper and peculiar to him; It ſeems ſhe is his difference in Grace, and that this Vertue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſheth him from Angels and Beaſts; For theſe have only a blind inſtinct that guides them, they have no liberty in their actions; It is not reaſon but Nature that leads them, and as they are incapable of Sin, ſo are they of Repentance. The Angels are unchangeable in good and evil; Conſtancy hath made the Angels happy, and Obſtinacy hath rendred the Devils miſerable; Theſe pure ſpirits cannot alter, and whether they know good and evil intuitively, or whether they act with the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their power: or whether they had but one moment to merit in, all Divinity aſſures us that they cannot repent. I intend not to examine whether Grace by its victorious ſweetneſs, be able to work a change in them: and whether their will be ſo perverſly obſtinate in evil, that it cannot be diverted; But I ſay with our Maſters, there is ſomething in their Nature and in their Sin, which renders them unworthy and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Repentance: ſo that this Vertue is a priviledge of a man, one of his properties in Nature, and one of his differences in Grace.</p>
                  <p>Being weak he never adheres ſo ſtrongly to Vertue, but he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert her; and by a happineſs ariſing from his infirmity, he is never ſo deeply engaged in vice, but he may ſhake hands with it. He is neither conſtant in good, nor obſtinate in evil: and though he can neither leave the one, nor embrace the other, unleſs he be aſſiſted by Grace, he hath a natural diſpoſition, which rendring him unconſtant, makes him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this happy change that accompanies Repentance. It ſeems the mercy of God which makes uſe of our ſin to redeem us, will make uſe of unconſtancy to convert us: and managing this weakneſs which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to us, takes pleaſure to ſave us by the ſame means that ruined us. If thoſe that are of opinion that the Grace that changeth men, were able alſo to convert the Angels, are not agreed as touching this Maxime, they ought at leaſt to confeſs that the Angel having had but one moment to merit in, was not capable of this Grace in the order of God, becauſe his Salvation or his Fall had immediately followed his Obedience or his Rebellion; and thus it is always true, that Repentance is a favour reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for man, and if it leane not upon the unconſtancy of his mind, it is founded at leaſt upon the length of his life, which ſeems therefore prolonged that he may have time to repent.</p>
                  <p>But if Repentance be not natural to man, 'tis at leaſt neceſſary for a ſinner; if it be not his difference, 'tis his remedy; if it be not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; 'tis his only refuge; and as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith, 'tis the Table after the Shipwrack. Man in Paradiſe might ſave himſelf by his Innocence;
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115672:135"/>this acceptable convoy had brought him through a Garden of Roſes; he had found pleaſure with vertue; he had conquered without fighting; and though he had had no enemies, he had not failed to triumph. But now there remains only Repentance which ſwims in bloud or in tears, which is covered with earth or with aſhes; which blots out no tranſgreſſions but by lamentations; ſatisfies not the Juſtice of God, but by preventing his arreſts; nor gaines any battles, but thoſe that coſt him fighs or wounds.</p>
                  <p>The ſinner following the Counſels of this auſtere Vertue, is always animated againſt himſelf; his whole life is ſpent in ſorrow; and ſince he loſt Grace, he is obliged to bid adiew to all pleaſure; his very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God diſpenſeth not with him from this ſeverity; To be a Chriſtian,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nullus hominiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tranſit ad Chriſtum ut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat eſſe quod non erat, niſi eu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poeniteat fuiſſe quod erat.</hi> Aug.</note> intitles him to be a Penitent; 'tis enough that he hath ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> to live in ſadneſs; and being a member of Jeſus Chriſt, he is bound over to penance. For though the union he contracts with this adorable Head in Baptiſm, happily deliver him from all his ſins, that he recovers Innocence with Grace, and be freed from all thoſe pains which are prepared for offenders in Hel: he becomes Penitent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Innocent, and the ſame Sacrament that ties him to Jeſus Chriſt, engageth him in griefs and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>The Son of God uniting the Divinity with the Humanity in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is pleaſed alſo to unite all things that ſeemed incompatible: Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſurpaſſed the difficulties that withſtood the accompliſhment of this myſtery; having accorded power with weakneſs, Non-Entity with Beeing, Life with Death, he would make Innocence friends with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and charge himſelf with the pains our ſins deſerved, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſing the holineſs that made him impeccable; he was the moſt juſt and moſt afflicted of all men; he was equally divided between the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and the penitent; his ſoul reſented grief with joy, and at the ſame time that he reigned with the Angels, he ſuffered with Mortals: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his example, the greateſt Saints have laboured to joyne Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Innocence; His Mother the pureſt of Virgins, the Holieſt of Women, bare the infirmities of our nature, without contracting the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations; and to imitate her Son, was content to be miſerable, though ſhe were not criminal. Saint <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who was a ſinner but for ſome months, who received Grace in his mothers belly, who after the Virgin was the firſt object of the miracles of Jeſus, who was born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin: nor brought into the world with him the ignominious quality of a ſinner; This great Saint, I ſay, was the example of Penitents: he ſpent his whole life in the Deſarts; he had no other covering then that of Trees or Rocks; Earth ſerved him for a Bed, Sackcloth for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Water for Drink, and Locuſts for Food: He added the labours of preaching to the auſterity of penance; he reproved ſin with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; his generous freedome procured him the hatred of the great ones;
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115672:135"/>and for a recompence of ſo many vertues, he loſt his head at the intreaty of an inceſtuous woman.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs that the Chriſtian, having the honour to be a member of Jeſus Chriſt, is obliged to Repentance: the favour he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church, gives him no diſpenſation from this duty; and if he have the uſe of Reaſon when admitted to Baptiſm, his Contrition muſt precede that Sacrament, and recover his loſt Innocence by the aſſiſtance of this vertue. His obligation continues with his life: For as the Grace of Chriſtianity does not enfranchiſe him fully from Concupiſcence, but he groans ſtill under the weight of his irons, ſees his heart divided between Self-love and Charity, that both theſe principles make him act ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and having obeyed Grace, obeys Sin again; he is bound to run to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to deface his light offences with Tears, and to ſpend his whole life in Repentance.</p>
                  <p>It is the opinion of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who carries this truth on farther, and impoſeth a more ſevere law upon Chriſtians: for be will not have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence it ſelf to exempt them from Grief; he will have them ſigh, not becauſe of their ſin, but becauſe of their baniſhment; he will have them bewail their exile as long as long as it laſts; and condemning their cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that can finde any pleaſure in this ſad abode, ſaith, that the Believer who hath not an averſion for this mortal and periſhable life, can have no love for the Eternal and Beatifical: his regret ought to be an argument of his love; and that it becomes him to bemoan his abode upon earth, if he have a real deſire of being ſpeedily tranſlated to heaven.</p>
                  <p>This great Maſter of Grace ſeeks no other motives of Repentance then the miſeries of life; he thinks it ſufficient to ſad our hearts, that we live under the tyranny of ſin, that we feel the rebellions of the fleſh, and ſuffer the perſecution of the Elements: the juſtice of theſe continued pains teacheth us that we are guilty: the Prayer that Chriſt taught us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms us in this belief; and ſeeing we cannot be his diſciples except we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay <hi>Dimitte nobis debita noſtra,</hi> we muſt confeſs we are not free from ſin: otherwiſe the Church would abuſe the Faithful; the Son of God himſelf had involved us in an errour; and, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, asking pardon for a ſin we never committed, we ſhould utter a blaſphemy, becauſe we ſhould lye in the midſt of our moſt auguſt myſteries.</p>
                  <p>We cannot doubt then that Repentance is neceſſary for a Chriſtian, nor can we deny, that, to the end it may be profitable, it muſt be ſevere, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if the precedent ſins have been notorious. For as Repentance is a kinde of Juſtice, it proportions the Puniſhment to the Offence; it reſpects the quality of the delinquents, conſiders the Majeſtie offended, and caſting its eyes upon the torments of the damned, ſtrives to make ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of them in the revenge it takes upon Criminals. Let us carefully examine all theſe Reaſons, ſee the juſt motives we have to puniſh our ſelves; and, not to ſlatter our lazie negligence in ſo important a concernment, let
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:115672:136"/>us conſider the qualities of this Vertue.</p>
                  <p>Repentance is a Judgement, where, contrary to the ordinary Laws, the ſame Delinquent is Witneſs, Judge, and Executioner. In the quality of a Witneſs, he is bound to examine his Conſcience, to Wrack his Memory; to ſearch the inmoſt thoughts of his Minde, the ſecreteſt intentions of his Will, and to convent himſelf before himſelf, without Excuſe or Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As a Judge, he ought to conſider the Number and the Quality of the crimes, dextrouſly to examine the priſoner, carefully to obſerve the cauſe of the fault, and with Juſtice to pronounce ſentence whereby the Criminal may ſuffer according to his deſert, and the party offended receive fatisfaction to his dignity. And becauſe ſoul and body are both concerned in the ſin, they muſt be joyntly condemned: but the ſoul being the author of the iniquity, and the body but the miniſter or complice, he muſt begin the correction by an inward ſadneſs mixed with Fear and Love, and finiſh it by an external pain attended with Shame and Sorrow: For there would be a kinde of Injuſtice, to ſeparate thoſe in the Puniſhment that were Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the Fault: and the Repentance would be imperfect, did it not reach the body as well as the ſoul. Having pronounced righteous judgement, the Judge muſt take upon him the quality of the Executioner, and execute what himſelf hath ordained, being zealous for the Juſtice of God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying Self-love, ſo that he abandon it to Charity; and, full of anger and indignation, revenge Jeſus Chriſt upon his enemy. All true Penitents have done thus; the Contrition of their ſpirit hath produced the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their body; and having conceived a mortal diſpleaſure at their offences, they have obliged their eyes to bewail them, their hands to puniſh them, and their mouthes to confeſs them: They joyned Faſtings to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Watchings to Reading, Diſcipline to Obedience; that mortifying both ſoul and body, they might obtain pardon for both theſe offenders.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can yeeld ſuch aſſiſtance to ſo good a deſigne, as the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a ſecond quality of Repentance: For it takes the name from Pain; 'tis a Puniſhment as well as a Judgement; 'tis mingled with Grace and Rigour;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>In peccatorem poenitentia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntians pro Dei indignatione fungitur, &amp; temporali affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatione aeterna ſupplicia non di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam fruſtratur, ſed expungit.</hi> Tertul.</note> and, according to the conceit of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> 'tis an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eternal pains. The ſinner, if a believer, is not ignorant that his crimes, which inflict death upon his ſoul, merit hell: he knows very well the decree is gone out, the truth whereof he cannot queſtion; and that every tranſgreſſor that loſeth Grace, is worthy of the Torments the devil and his angels ſuffer: When he is converted therefore, and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Repentance hath his ſins remitted, he is obliged in ſpirit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the centre of the earth, to conſider the pains the damned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; and then, to equalize his ſorrow, he ought to imitate what he hath ſeen, and to deal ſo ſeverely with himſelf, that he may ſatisfie that Juſtice which inflicts eternal puniſhments upon his enemies.</p>
                  <p>But nothing ought ſo much to animate him againſt himſelf, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his offence, which being in its own nature infinite, merits
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:115672:136"/>eternal puniſhments. For though the ſin be committed in a moment,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Momentaneum eſt quod dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat, aeternum eſt quod cruciat.</hi> Greg. Mag.</note> and the pleaſure that accompanies it be but an illuſion; yet doth it put the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in a condition out of which he cannot ariſe but by Grace, which is not at his diſpoſal: He falls into this abyſs by his own proper motion, but he cannot get out of it by his own ſtrength: He may defend himſelf when he is tempted; but, being overcome, he cannot rid himſelf of his enemy: He enters into a ſlavery that inſenſibly engageth him into a neceſſity: If Grace, which he cannot challenge as his due, prevent him not, he lives and dies in a very deplorable condition, and carries the ſame minde into hell which he cheriſhed upon the earth: Therefore doth the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that reads mens hearts, and looks rather upon the diſpoſitions then actions of offenders, inflict an eternal puniſhment upon a ſin not fully fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and condemns a tranſgreſſor to endleſs torments, who had always offended, had he always lived.</p>
                  <p>But though he ſhould not retain this unhappie diſpoſition till his death, 'tis enough to merit an everlaſting puniſhment, that he hath committed a ſin whoſe malice hath no bounds: For Reaſon tells us there is no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Creature and the Creator; the diſtance that ſeparates them is infinite; and therefore the ſinner that forſakes the Creator to adhere is infinite;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui peccat mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliter, vult De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um eſſe impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtum, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipientem; quia vellet Deum aut ſua peccata ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcire, aut vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care non poſſe, aut vindicare nolle.</hi> Bern.</note> offers him an infinite injury, which cannot juſtly be puniſhed but by an eternaltorment. Indeed, he endeavours to deſtroy God by his offence; he would rob him of his perfections; and in the minde he is in, to content himſelf, he would have God void of light to ſee him, without goodneſs to hate him, without power to correct him. Therefore is the Penitent, at the ſight of ſo many diſorders and injuſtices, obliged to make war upon himſelf, to take Gods part againſt himſelf, to puniſh a delinquent ſeverely whoſe due it is to burn eternally, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a torment during his life, which ought to continue for all generations.</p>

                  <p>Therefore are all Chriſtians, after the imitation of ſo rare an example, obliged to deſpoil themſelves of their Wills, to renounce their Deſires, to ſubmit to Jeſus Chriſt, and to manifeſt in their perſon an image of the Incarnation: 'Twas certainly this powerful reaſon that made the great Apoſtle to utter theſe notable words: <hi>Vivo autem jam non ego, vivit vero in me Chriſtus,</hi> and to teach us, by his advice, to derive our guidance, as well as our glory, from the Son of God. Indeed, the whole Abnegation of a Chriſtian is founded upon the myſtery of the Incarnation; and when they conſider how the holy Humanity is obſcured in the deſarts, humbled in the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115672:137"/>Villages, ſacrificed upon Mount <hi>Calavary,</hi> to be obedient to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Word, they need not think it ſtrange if to doe Homage to Jeſus Chriſt, they are obliged to renounce their glory, and conſent to lay down their lives at his command.</p>
                  <p>But if this example be not powerful enough to perſwade us, we muſt be convinced by reaſon, and confeſs, that Chriſtians have no quality that that doth not exact this blind ſubmiſſion from them: For if we conſider them as Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, or Members of the Son of God, we are forced to acknowledge that theſe two glorious qualities are as well the Fountains of their dependance as of their greatneſs. Temples are only for the Divinity that honours them with his preſence; they breath forth nothing but his glory, and were they inanimated, they would act meerly by his motions: Therefore inaſmuch as Chriſtians are the living Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, they ought not to act but as guided by him; they are unable to perform any thing but by his order; and all their actions that have not his Grace for their principle, are Criminal or profane. We are no more the children of God, but as far as we are quickned by this ever to be adored Spirit; all our merit is from our acting by his Vertue, and when he ceaſeth to incite and ſtir us up, we leave off to form good thoughts, or perform good actions.</p>
                  <p>The quality of Members ties us not leſſe cloſely to our Head, then that of Temples to the Holy Ghoſt: for according to the Laws of Nature, the Members more belong to their Head, then ſlaves doe to their Maſter; they receive life and motion from his Influences; they owe all their vigour to the communication they have with him: aand whenever there happens any obſtruction that hinders him from ſending his Spirits into his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they loſe all ſenſe and ſtrength; Beſides, he hath ſuch command over them, that he applies them according to his deſigns, takes no notice of their wils; employs the eyes to weep as well as ſee; the hand to ſerve as well as command; the tongue to manage meat, as well as compoſe words; and as if it were their greateſt glory to periſh for him, there is not any Member but willingly expoſeth it ſelf to death for his defence or honour.</p>
                  <p>This ſubmiſſion is an Image of the dependance Chriſtians ought to have towards Jeſus Chriſt; they are no longer their own, when once ingraffed upon his perſon; they receive an obligation to obey, from the ſame quality that gives them a power to operate;
<note place="margin">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:115672:138"/>themſelves ſufficiently happy, if they can be ſerviceable to his Glory; it matters not though they loſe their lives, provided they obey him; and knowing very well that in the State, and in Nature, ſubjects expoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for their Prince, Members for their Head, they are of this mind aſſoon as ever they enter into the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Indeed we are the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt; he hath bought us by his death; we are the price of his bloud, and we owe our happineſs and our hope to his merits: This is it that the Apoſtle repreſents to us in ſuch emphatical terms, when he ſaith, <hi>Empti eſtis pretio magno:</hi> and by a neceſſary conſequence teacheth us, that we ought to glorifie him in our body and in our ſoul. Thence it is that he infers, that thoſe that live upon his bounty, ought to live for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; Thence he concludes, that we offer our members as oblations, and employ all that we are for the glory of our Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>Slaves in the negotiations of the world, could not diſpoſe of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; they acted by order of their Maſter; they took pains for his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; they got wealth for his profit; and as if nature had loſt her right in their perſons, they got children to increaſe his family. Philoſophers acknowledge, that ſervitude fals only upon the body, that it fetters on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the feet and the hands, leaving the ſlaves more free many times in their irons, then the Soveraigns upon their Throne. Bondage hath no domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over their wil, and with all her rigours cannot extort the leaſt baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from them, if they be generous; they diſpute their liberty with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; they preſerve in deed what they have loſt in appearance; they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times command their oppreſſour, and bearing the hearts of Kings in the bodies of ſlaves, are more free and more happy then their Maſter. But the Chriſtian enters by Redemption into a Thraldome, which paſſeth from his body into his ſoul; fetters his heart with his hands; triumphs over his liberty without conſtraining it; confiſcates all his goods to his Soveraign; and deſpoiling him of all but Nothingneſs and Sin, obligeth him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that he owes all the reſt to the Liberaility of his Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of this Verity, which makes one of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Chriſtianity, we muſt know, that though God be the Soveraign of all men, he treats not the innocent and the guilty alike; He ſeems to reſpect the former, to refuſe them nothing that they deſire, preventing their wiſhes: and in that happy ſtate wherein Concupiſcence had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered them, he ſubjected their ſalvation to their liberty, and made them in ſome ſort the diſpoſers or maſters of their good fortune: Grace is always at the door of their heart, this Divine aſſiſtance never fails them, and God would think he violated the Laws of his Juſtice, had he not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115672:138"/>theſe Innocents all that is neceſſary for their ſalvation; But he deals far otherwiſe with Guilty men; It ſeems Sin gives him more right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe wretches, then Nothing does: and being fallen from their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges by their own fault, he owes them nothing but puniſhments; He abandons them to their own conduct, leaves them in blindneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and as if they were meerly the objects of his anger, he ſometimes withdraws from them the aſſiſtance of his Grace. Thus did the Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deal with men before the myſtery of the Incarnation; his Son found them in this deplorable condition, when he undertook their deliverance: they had no right neither to Grace nor Glory; and ſin that had deprived them of their innocence, had confiſcated all their apennages. Thus we owe our Salvation to our Redemption; we hold that of Mercy, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we held of Juſtice; we are ſaved rather as men enfranchiſed, then free: and acknowledging our ſalvation an effect rather of Grace then our own freedome, we ought to renounce the one to give our ſelves over to the other.</p>
                  <p>This conceit carries me inſenſibly to another, which ſeems only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent of this; and the coherence they have, will not give me leave to divide them. Man in the ſtate of Innocence, was the maſter of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the uprightneſs wherein he was created, was the cauſe that God left him to his liberty; having no inordinate motions to regulate, no wild paſſions to ſubdue, no unfaithful ſenſes to correct, he had need only of a ſuccour to ſuſtain him; His will was the principle of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and the good works he did, proceeded rather from himſelf, then from God; Thus his good fortune was in a manner in his own hands; he depended more upon Liberty then upon Grace: and being the Director of this, he might ſay without vanity, that he was the principal Authour of his own ſalvation; Divine Providence obliged him to take the guidance of himſelf, to determine his own actions, that he was the maſter of his fortune, and making uſe of the advantages ſhe had given him, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the victory was due only to his own courage and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity; But now that he is faln from his Innocence, hath loſt half his Light, and Liberty, carries a Tyrant in his very Eſſentials, which ſubjects him to his Laws, he ſtands in need of a Grace that may deliver him: and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a dominion over his will, may ſave him by a more humble, but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer way then that of <hi>Adam;</hi> He is no longer the Maſter of his actions, nor the Authour of his ſalvation: he muſt take direction from Jeſus Chriſt, learn to deny himſelf, diſtruſt his own abilities, and place his hope in that victorious Grace which ſubjects whoſe man, captivating his underſtanding by Faith, and his will by Love.</p>
                  <p>This Oeconomy of God towards the Chriſtian is mixed with Juſtice and Mercy: 'tis Juſtice to take from him the diſpoſall of his perſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he uſed it ſo ill in the ſtate of Innocence; 'Tis Juſtice to ſubmit his Liberty to Grace, becauſe when he was the maſter thereof, he negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115672:139"/>to make uſe of it; 'Tis Juſtice to treat him as a Pupil or a Slave, not to truſt him any more with the government of himſelf, and to employ for his cure a remedy, which reproacheth him with his blindneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity. 'Tis Mercy alſo to knock off the fetters of a ſlave: to indulge him the true liberty his ſin had deprived him of; to unite him to God from whom he was eſtranged; to aſſure his ſalvation by a Grace which infallibly produceth its effect; to ſanctifie him in Jeſus Chriſt whereof he is a Member: and to give him an occaſion to offer himſelf an Holocauſt to God.</p>
                  <p>For it is true, that ſelf-denial is a parting with all things; a ſacrifice wherein man immolates his will by obedience; a combat wherein he tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over himſelf; where he is the vanquiſher, and the vanquiſhed; where he ſubdues his paſſions by reaſon, and ſubjects his reaſon to grace. After this advantage there is none but he may with Juſtice hope for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that hath conquered himſelf, may eaſily conquer all others; 'Tis a puniſhment which in hardſhip and durance diſputes with that of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: It is long, becauſe it laſts as long as life, may take up the beſt part of an age: nor ſpares the ſtrength of the penitent, but to make him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more; It is rigorous, becauſe there is no cruelties a man given over to grace, does not exerciſe upon his perſon: and being witty to invent torments, converts all things into corrections; For as Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great ſaith, he ſuppreſſeth vanity by the ſword of the Word of God; he cuts off his head to ingraffe Jeſus Chriſt upon his body; he makes all die that he received from the old <hi>Adam,</hi> to make all live that he hath drawn from the new: and if he cut not off his arms and his legs, he pares away his deſires and his hopes to give Jeſus Chriſt ſome teſtimonies of his love: Therefore doth the Scripture inform us, that there is no Vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a greater recompence then Self-denial. The Man that is knockt off from himſelf is united to the Son of God: the creatures reſpect him, the Sun obeys his word, and 'tis in this ſenſe that the Scripture to make his Panegyrick, is not content to ſay, that he pronounceth Oracles, but addes, that he gains Battles, and bears away victories by ſpeaking: All things ſtoop to his commands, and more glorious then the firſt man, who could not uſe the creatures but according to their inclinations; he diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them to make himſelf feared, and teſtifies the power he hath in the ſtate of his Maſter, by the command he exerciſeth over all the parts of the Univerſe. Thus Self-denial which ſeems to abaſe men, raiſeth them up; the Vertue that entertains them in the diſtruſt of their weakneſs, gives them admittance into the power of God: and that which obligeth them to renounce their own will, makes them find the accompliſhment of all their deſires.</p>

Following therefore his intentions, I have joyned in the ſame Treatiſe what he hath joyned in the ſame Myſtery; and reſolve to manifeſt the wonders of this Food, and the Prodigies of this Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Reaſon, that teacheth us that Nouriſhment is the ſtaff of Life, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us alſo that every living thing hath need of Nouriſhment; and that the Divine Providence, whoſe care is extended over all the Creatures, hath left none without aliment: This feedeth the Fowls of the air; and the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115672:140"/>confeſſeth, it provided for the neceſſities of their young, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by the dams: It maketh Graſs to grow in the deſarts for the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; and Rain, which ſeems unprofitably to fall into the Sea, ſerves for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and meat for the Fiſhes. Inaſmuch as Men are Gods maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, he takes a particular care to nouriſh them: whole Nature labours to furniſh their Table; her fruitfulneſs is onely to ſatisfie their hunger, or content their appetite; and every Creature ſhe teems with, ſeems a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim to be immolated to preſerve their life. But as they have Three Lives that anſwer to the Three Orders of Nature, of Grace, and of Glory, God hath given them Three ſorts of Food, which, in the difference of their qualities, ceaſe not to have wonderful Correſpondencies.</p>
                  <p>The Earth is the Nurſe that furniſheth us our chiefeſt nouriſhment: that Divine word, <hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini,</hi> which enricht her with fruitfulneſs in the very birth, hath preſerved this prolifical vertue in the ſucceſſion of ſo many yeers; and if the Juſtice of God make her not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren for our puniſhment, ſhe returns with uſury the laborious pains of the Husbandman. Corn, which is our principal ſupport, is multiplied by its corruption; 'tis born by death; and making us ſee an image of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, perſwades us our bodies may riſe out of the Grave, after they have been reſolved to duſt, becauſe the Grain ſprings not up till it be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified in the earth: This production would paſs for a Miracle, were it not ſo common; and to obſerve the wonders thereof, would be ſufficient to oblige all men to reverence the power and wiſdom of the Creator. For when the Corn is corrupted, it puts forth a bud, which cleaves the earth, and covers it with a tuft of Graſs, which preſerves its verdure in the midſt of the ſharpeſt Winters: At the Spring, it thruſts forth a ſtalk, which riſeth inſenſibly, and from time to time is ſtrengthned with joynts to reſiſt the violence of the windes: Upon the top is formed an Ear, wherein Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeems to employ all her induſtry;

The heat of the Summer compleats the whole work, gives it Colour in giving it Maturity; and gently opening the ſeveral cells which lock up the treaſure of the Husbandman, admoniſheth him to prepare for the Harveſt.</p>
                  <p>If this Wonder raviſh us, and if we are bound to reverence the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence which makes the earth fruitful to nouriſh us; we are not leſs concerned to admire the prodigious alterations it cauſeth in Nature to increaſe proviſion: For it makes uſe onely of Rain to enrich us, and from this inexhauſted ſource draws ſo many different Fruits, that if their number pleaſe us, their qualities aſtoniſh us. Rain is nothing but a Vapour in the conception; the Sun ſports with it in the air, thickens it into a cloud, to take it out of our ſight; then deſtroying his own work, diſſolves it into ſhowers, to water the thirſty earth. In the mean time, this Rain is turned
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115672:140"/>into all things it toucheth, takes the nature and quality of thoſe things it bathes, and, by a miraculous Metamorphoſis, is changed into Wine falling upon grapes, into Oil upon olives: It contracts the taſte of all Fruits, and the colour of all Flowers: It grows yellow upon the Marigolds, red upon Pinks, white upon Lilies; and though, when it falls, it have neither taſte nor colour, yet may it boaſt it gives both to all Fruits and all Flowers.</p>
                  <p>This prodigious change which is daily wrought upon the earth, is but an overture of that which is made upon the Body of Man, to maintain it: For all the Nouriſhment he receives, is digeſted by the Stomack, and is turned to Blood in the Liver; thence it is conveyed by the Veins into all the parts of the body; which aſſimilating it into their ſubſtance, gives it as many forms as they themſelves have. There, by a ſtrange prodigie, the ſame aliment is ſoftned into Fleſh, hardned into Bones, ſtiffned into Sinews, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into Cartilages: its ſuperfluities are not uſeleſs; and, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe Phyſitians, they ſerve to nouriſh our Hair and our Nails, whereof the firſt is the ornament of the Head, the ſecond the defence of the Hand. Who will not acknowledge that Man is very dear to God, ſince he works ſo many Miracles to feed him, and produceth ſo many ſeveral Meats to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a life common to him with beaſts?</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as that of the Soul is much more noble, the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby it is preſerved is exceedingly more excellent: and if in the order of Nature God hath made ſo many prodigies to nouriſh Man, he works many more in the order of Grace to entertain the Chriſtian. For the body of his oncly Son is the food of the Faithful; they live upon that Blood which begat them on the Croſs; that the ſame Principle which gave them their life, may preſerve it. This Body is formed upon our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars by the Word of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; the Prieſts are onely the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters or Interpreters; they repeat what he delivered in the Supper; they do that in the Church, that he did at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and offering up this Sacrifice to the Eternal Father, make proviſion to nouriſh the Faithful. Thus, in Nature and in Grace, 'tis the Word of God that makes us live; and we may truely ſay, <hi>Non in ſolo pane vivit homo, ſed in omni verbo quod procedit ex ore Dei.</hi> But this Bread that nouriſheth our ſouls, is not of the ſame quality with that that nouriſheth our Bodies: For the Corn whereof this is made, owes its Life to its Death, nor can increaſe till it be corrupted; but that which is exhibited to us upon our Altars, felt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely on the Croſs, where dying to procure us life, he himſelf boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was the Grain of Corn whoſe fruitfulneſs proceeds from its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: <hi>Si mortuum fuerit, multum fructum affert.</hi> But now it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible in our Tabernacles; death can no more injure it; the Glory that inveſts it, ſecures it from our fury as well as our wrongs.</p>
                  <p>We muſt acknowledge nevertheleſs, that its preſence depends upon the ſpecies that cover it; it ceaſeth to be with us, when the heat hath digeſted
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115672:141"/>them, or time conſumed them: and though he remain by his Grace, his body is abſent, which is tied to accidents, as to chains his love hath forged for it. He never diſpenſeth with this bondage; the treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> could not make him violate the laws he had preſcribed; the blinde fury of Hereticks cannot compel him out of this priſon; and the impiety of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hath not been able to force him to quit their hearts, till the ſpecies that preſerved him there be conſumed by the natural heat: He is as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to obſerve his promiſes, as to obey the will of his Father: and as the blaſphemies of the Jews could not make him deſcend from the Croſs to give them proofs of his Innocence and of his Divinity, the ſacriledges of prophane Chriſtians cannot make him deſert the Hoaſt, where his love and fidelity hold him priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Though he be ſubject to all theſe humiliations to become our nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he is not liable, for all that, to all the conditions of Nutriment: For he paſſeth not into our ſubſtance, he is not changed into thoſe that receive him, and in his debaſement he reſerves himſelf the power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them into him: His being our Food, hinders him not from being our God: he acts upon thoſe that feed upon him; he makes an impreſſion of his Divine qualities in their ſouls; and if he changeth not their Nature, at leaſt he makes them change their Condition and their Life. Neither ought this to ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that conſider that Natural meats com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their qualities to us; and, by a mutual Metamorphoſis, we are changed into them, when they are aſſimilated into us. 'Tis believed that <hi>Nero</hi> was therefore cruel, becauſe he ſuckt the milk of a cruel Nurſe; and that <hi>Achilles</hi> was therefore valiant, becauſe his Maſter nouriſhed him with the marrow of Lions: Experience it ſelf teacheth us that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple draw their humours from the earth that bears them, and the heaven that covers them: Thoſe that are bred among Rocks, are ſavage; thoſe that live in the fertile Plains, are more tractable: Therefore we need not wonder if the Chriſtians, feeding upon a Divine meat, do ſo eaſily change their inclinations,

And from this Principle do the Fathers draw the obligation the Chriſtians have to be gods upon earth, becauſe they receive a God in the Euchariſt; who, acting according to the extent of his power, would transform them into himſelf, were not his Divine operations hindered by the weakneſs or malice of the recipient.</p>
                  <p>But that which is begun upon Earth, is happily perfected in Heaven; where Divinity being the food of the Bleſſed, raiſeth them to a condition, where, leaving off to be Mortals, they commence Gods: Indeed, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture teacheth us that the Beatifical ſtate is a Feaſt, where God communicating his Eſſence to Angels and Men, makes them, in one diſh, taſte all imaginable delights: For though there be diverſity of conditions among the Bleſſed, though the degrees of Glory anſwer the degrees of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115672:141"/>Love, and thoſe who have been moſt affectionate, are thoſe that God moſt honours: yet all Theology confeſſeth, that the Divine Eſſence is the only object of their felicity; that every one enjoys all without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion; that though common to all, 'tis notwithſtanding proper to each particular; that being wholly communicated to one, it takes nothing from the reſt: and more excellent then the light which enlightens one man as perfectly as the whole world; it is as fully communicated to the loweſt Angel, as to the higheſt Seraphim.</p>
                  <p>God is divided upon the Earth without intereſſing his ſimplicity, he communicates himſelf to the faithful, but in part: and handling every one according to their Merit and his Grate, is not always the ſame to one that he is to another. He hath manifeſted his Wiſdome in <hi>Solomon,</hi> his Clemency in <hi>David,</hi> his Patience in <hi>Job,</hi> his Love in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> his Zeal in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> his Purity in Saint <hi>John,</hi> and his other perfections in the reſt of the Faithful. But at the end of the world, God will be all in all things; he will poure out that in abundance, which now he deals forth in meaſure: and all the Saints poſſeſſing all the Vertues, ſhall poſſeſſe God in all his perfections.</p>
                  <p>But the chiefeſt advantage of this Divine Banquet, is, that the Meſs which is ſerved up, will be inſtead of all things: as long as we live upon the Earth, the miſery of our condition, or the frailty of our goods, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us not to find our contentment in one ſingle object; That which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays our hunger, quencheth not our thirſt; that which enlightens us, covers us not; that which ſerves us for a garment, ſerves us not for a houſe; and that which ſatisfies our mind, does not always content our body: But when we ſhall be in Heaven, the Divine Eſſence will fill all our deſires; and being infinite, will alone abundantly ſupply the fulneſs of all periſhable Earthly goods. Your God, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſhall be your All; you ſhall feed upon him, to ſatisfie your hunger; drink him, to quench your thirſt; reſt upon him, for your ſupport; make him your garment, to cover you; you ſhall wholly poſſeſs, and he as whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs you; you ſhall find in him all that others doe, becauſe both you and they ſhall be but one and the ſame thing in him.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt effect of this viand, whereof we have but an eſſay in the Euchariſt, is, that it will perfectly transform us into it ſelf, becauſe all Scripture teacheth us, that when we ſee God, we ſhall be like him:

                        <hi>Scimus quoniam cum apparuerit ſimiles ei eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> Joan.</note> and that Glory having conſumed all that was mortal and periſhable in our nature, we ſhall be happily ſwallowed up in him without ceaſing for all this to be our ſelves. Thus God nouriſheth us in nature with the fruits of the Earth, which maintain a body taken out of the Earth; in Grace by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, which preſerves the life he merited for us upon the Croſſe; In Glory by Divinity it ſelf, which is both together our food and our felicity.</p>

Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> that hath written moſt ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, confounds them ſo often one with another, that he ſeems to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Tree of Life, that which appertains to Original Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For though we know that this united the ſoul with the body, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected both to God, and preſerving the one from ſin, exempted the other from death; yet he forbears not to impute that to the Tree of Life, which we impute to Grace, and to allot it ſo many advantages, that it ſeems the whole happineſſe of man depended abſolutely upon this miraculous Tree.</p>
                  <p>But having well conſidered the words of this great Saint: I find his doctrine ſo conformable to Scripture, that there is no doubt but it was ſuggeſted to him by the ſame Spirit that made <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeak in <hi>Geneſis.</hi> For as nouriſhment is ordained to preſerve our life, we need not think it ſtrange that it holds ſome analogy with the principle that gives it us: and that there ſhould be ſome agreement between the matter whereof we are made, and that wherewith we are nouriſhed. Therefore may we ſay, that the Tree of Life preſerved in Innocent man, all that Original Righteouſneſs had indued him with: and that the fruit thereof, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was a figure of the holy Sacrament, repaired the waſts of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, maintained man in his vigour, and ſecured him from death. Wherein I find a great reſemblance with truth, becauſe it wrought that in man an Innocent, which the Body of the Son of God doth in man a Chriſtian; For there is none but confeſſeth, that this admirable fruit united the ſoul with the body, that it entertained that good intelligence which made up a notable part of his happineſs, and ſubjecting the body to the ſoul, by a neceſſary conſequence ſubjected the ſoul to God.</p>
                  <p>Divinity hath not yet fully examined, whether this Vertue were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to this Tree, or whether being but a viſible ſign of an invſible grace, the Divine power produced this effect in man when he took of that fruit with the diſpoſitions of a firm faith and an humble obedience. If we
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115672:142"/>take the Scripture for our Guide, and Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> for its Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be eaſie to judge that this effect depended not upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Man, but upon the Vertue of the Tree, becauſe we ſee in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> that one of the reaſons why our forefather was driven out of Paradiſe, was, that he might not eat of that wonderful fruit; and ſo the miſeries he had contracted by ſin, be prolonged together with his life. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> explicating this paſſage, makes us plainly ſee, that man having loſt Original Righteouſneſs, had not loſt Immortality, if he had continued to feed upon the fruit of the Tree of Life. Thus we are forced to confeſs, that this Tree had a ſecret Vertue which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not upon the ſole diſpoſition of man: and that it was capable of producing a quality in his body, which deſending him for a time from death, had encreaſed his misfortune with his years.</p>
                  <p>But not to engage in a queſtion more curious then profitable, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to know that as this fruit of the Tree of Life ſubjected the body to the ſoul, and the ſoul to God, the Euchariſt produceth the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the Chriſtian: and being received with the diſpoſitions requiſite to this Sacrament, calms the paſſions weakens Concupiſcence, enthrones reaſon: For though Baptiſme leave Concupiſcence to exerciſe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and this Sacrament which opens him the Gate of the Church, gives him not victory together with life; yet all the Fathers confeſs, that the Euchariſt more powerful then Baptiſm, furniſheth them with forces to ſet upon this domeſtick enemy; that it ſweetens his fury in combating him, and that the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt delivers him from this evil, more obſtinate then the Devil and Sin: For whether the purity of his fleſh cures ours by a holy contagion, or whether Concupiſcence trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the apprehenſion of a body which is the work of the Holy Ghoſt; or whether laſtly, this Sacrament that preſerves our life gives us ſtrength, and delivers us from that languiſhing impotency which ſeems the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul of Concupiſcence: we find by experience, that the body of the Son of God procures us the victory, and prepares us the triumph.</p>
                  <p>If it defend us, it nouriſheth us: and if it pacifie our diſorders, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the devaſtations the heat of ſelf-love makes in our ſouls; In which reſpect, 'tis certainly the truth of the Tree of Life, and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that figure: For though Innocent Man had other meats beſides that; and excepting the forbidden fruit, all others that Paradiſe afforded, were allowed him; yet was he obliged to take of this from time to time as a medicine which the mercy of God had prepared for him, to defend him againſt the Natural heat which inſenſibly waſted him. Whence it is eaſie to infer, that in the ſtate of Innocence, the body of man was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of parts that could not agree; That fire which makes man live, devoured the radical moiſture on which it feeds: and though he daily took in nouriſhment, which being much purer then ours, might preſerve life much longer; yet had he need of an extraordinary diet which might
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115672:143"/>repair the ruines the natural heat made in his body; and Divines Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which never abandons that ſinner, provided the Tree of Life for Innocent Man, to defend him againſt the internal enemy, who had inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly brought him to death by means of old age and conſumption.</p>
                  <p>Thus may we ſay, that the body of the Son of God ſhields us againſt that forain heat,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Concupiſcentia carnis in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmo dimitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non ut non ſit, ſed ut non obſit &amp; non imput tur.</hi> Aug. lib. de Nup. &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cup. cap. 25.</note> which ſetting upon the warmth of Charity, threatens the Chriſtian with death. For though Concupiſcence ſince Baptiſm, be no longer ſin: and if ſometimes they give it this name, 'tis becauſe it is the principal effect; yet is ſhe not idle in our ſouls; ſhe makes ſtrange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes, when her fury is not ſtopt; ſhe makes uſe of all occaſions that are offered, and holding under her command the paſſions and the ſenſes, ſhe endeavours by their mediation to enſlave the underſtanding and the will; Though never ſo weak and langniſhing in Chriſtians, ſhe hath ſtill vigour enough to engage them in ſin, if their reaſon aſſiſted with grace, continually oppoſe not her deſigns: The little remainder there is, makes them they cannot live ſecure, and as long as they nouriſh the leaſt degree of ſelf-love, there is no crime whereof they have not the ſeeds in them. What the Son of God hath ſaid of the grain of Muſtard ſeed, which is ſo ſmall at firſt, and ſo prodigious in the progreſs, is not comparable to Concupiſcence, whoſe leaſt ſparks are able to kindle mighty conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which only the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt can extinguiſh. Indeed his Body, the nobleſt Organ of his Spirit, moderates daily theſe heats in the Euchariſt, ſmothers the flames Concupiſcence ſtirs up to conſume us; he gives beeing to that vertue that fight obſcenity; weakens that ſtrange burning which glows againſt divine heat, without which a Chriſtian can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live; He produceth two contrary effects which manifeſts his power to be infinite: For by kindling one fire, he quencheth another: and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming us with his own love, happily delivers us from that of ſelf; 'Tis a a wonderful Wine, which contrary to the nature of ordinary wine, bears Virgins, and renders them pure, thereby to render them pregnant in Vertues: Finally, 'tis a Bread of Life, that nouriſheth ſoul and body, carrying vigour into the one, and light into the other, to the end that preſerving the whole man, it may be his food in health, and his remedy in ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>Having contrary to the Laws of Phyſick cured him, contrary to the Laws of Nature, it endeavours to make him young; For Religion more powerful then the Fable, hath found out a ſecret to renue the Chriſtians youth in the Euchariſt, and to diſcover in Myſteries what it made us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Types and Figures. Indeed all the Fathers are of opinion that the Tree of Life defended man from old age, and preſerved him from that languiſhing conſumption, which diſpoſed him inſenſibly to his death; if common fruits could preſerve his life, they were unable to maintain his vigour; Though they had all the purity Innocent Nature could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh her works with, yet in repairing mans ſtrength, they had not reſtored
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115672:143"/>that freſhneſs which accompanies youth: To ſecure himſelf from that miſchief which had not reſpected his Innocence, he was obliged to have recourſe to the Tree of Life, and from time to time to take an agreeable Phyſick, which being no way diſtaſteful, reſtored him his primitive vigour, and re-inſtated him in that flouriſhing age he was at firſt created in. It is true, that as Prudence was natural to him, he never expected length of days to impair his beauty, nor that old-age ſhould print wrinkles upon his face: he made ſuch ſeaſonable uſe of this remedy, that the freſhneſs of his complexion never faded: The Roſes and the Lilies were always ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on his cheeks: age and deformity never ſeized a body whoſe ſoul was exempt from ſin; and the fruit of the Tree of Life ſeconding his ordinary food, maintained him in a vigorous conſtitution, which was afraid nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sickneſs nor Weakneſs. In this happie ſtate, Man had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the Aged, and not their imperfections: his Reaſon, without the tedious trouble of Experience, was furniſhed with all Lights requiſite to conduct him; he had no need to enfeeble his body to fortifie his minde; but both the parts that compoſed him being equally innocent, he had no occaſion to wiſh that age might weaken the one to make it more obedient, nor ſtrengthen the other to render it more abſolute. Thus the fruit of the Tree of Life maintained Man in Youth and Innocence; and theſe two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable qualities combating Old-age and Sin, made him ſpend his life happily and holily.</p>
                  <p>Although Chriſtians have not this advantage upon the earth, and that their body, being ſtill the ſlave of Concupiſcence, cannot avoid the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities incident to old-age; yet in their ſouls they fail not to enjoy the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of Innocence; they finde in the holy Sacrament, what <hi>Adam</hi> found in the Tree of Life; they receive a new vigour in the Euchariſt; their ſouls grow young as often as they approach to Jeſus Chriſt: when, like Eagles, they ſoar as high as this Sun lodg'd in a cloud, they are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that in the infirmity of their fleſh their ſpirit is renewed; and that the outward man falling to decay by yeers and penance, the inward man recruits by the heavenly meat he feeds upon. This Miracle paſſeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the ſoul to the body; yet there have been ſome holy perſons who taking no other ſuſtenance but what is offered upon our Altars, have lived many yeers. Many times this Nutriment hath imprinted its quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon their bodies; and darting forth certain rays of Grace upon their countenances, communicated to them a part of that beauty which the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirits ſhall poſſeſs.

                  <p>If this ſacred Nutriment always produce not this Miracle, at leaſt we
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115672:144"/>muſt acknowledge it gives us an Earneſt of the Reſurrection, and a right to Immortality: In which reſpect, I finde it as powerful and as happie as the fruit of the Tree of Life. One of the wonders of this Tree was, in the judgement of all the Fathers, to ſecure Man from diſſolution; and ſo firmly to unite the ſoul with the body, that the number of yeers could not ſeparate them. Death reſpected not onely Original righteouſneſs, but the fruit of the Tree of Life; and though it might grow from the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xture of the Elements which compoſed the body of Man, it durſt not ſet upon him as long as original righteouſneſs maintained their good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence, or this convenient remedy hindered their diviſion. Thus Man was not Immortal ſo much by his own conſtitution, as by a borrowed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; that the obligation he had to make uſe of it, might inſtruct him that he owed all theſe advantages to the liberality of his Creator. Now it is certain that the Euchariſt works all theſe Miracles daily in the Church: for it imprints an occult vertue in our bodies, which is as a Pledge of the Reſurrection; it ſheds abroad in our members the ſeeds of an eternal life; and by a holy contagion, which corruption it ſelf cannot deprive us of, communicates a certain right to Immortality: For we have the word of the Son of God for a caution of this immutable verity; and after the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſes he hath made in the Goſpel, we may, without wronging his Greatneſs, affirm, that his Juſtice obligeth him to give the Chriſtians a Reſurrection, and that he cannot deny a habitation in heaven to thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that have ſerved him for temples upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>If he prevent not Death, but ſuffer this faithful miniſter of his Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to exerciſe ſo many cruelties upon our body, 'tis to deliver us from him with greater pomp and power: if he give him leave to reduce us to duſt, 'tis to make us riſe out of the Grave, as the Phoenix from her fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-pile; 'tis, finally, that having had a part in his Shame, we may ſhare in his Glory; and that it may be ſaid of all the Elect, what S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid heretofore of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that the Son of God forbore to cure him, that he might raiſe him; and was unwilling to lift him from his Bed, that he might call him out of his Grave, and ſeal his love by the greatneſs of his Miracle.</p>

                  <p>THe Types and Figures of the Old Teſtament are, in reſpect of our Myſteries, what Enigma's are in reſpect of Truth: They conceal and diſcover them to our eyes; their ſhadows have ſome glimmerings of light; and theſe tranſparent clouds occaſion the bright breaking forth of thoſe Stars they rob us of. They inſtruct the Learned; and the leaſt meaſure of underſtanding they have of the Goſpel, makes them eaſily conceive what the jews were not able to comprehend. When this people ſaw the Manna deſcend in the wilderneſs, they never minded the ſecrets to come; and without diving into the deſignes of God, believed that his Divine Providence was pleaſed to give them that miraculous bread in a place where Humane Prudence could not poſſibly procure any. But there is not the meaneſt Chriſtian, inſtructed in the School of Jeſus Chriſt, but underſtands that it was a Figure of the Euchariſt; and that God intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prepare our mindes for his Maſter-piece by this eſſay, wrought this Miracle for no other end but to perſwade us of thoſe he would one day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit upon our Altars.

The holy Scripture hath left it this glorious name, that, entering in the minde of this people, we may admire the wonders God wrought to nouriſh them in the deſarts: But certainly we may truely ſay, without offending the Iſraelites, that their wonder aroſe from their ignorance; that they had not been ſo raviſhed with this prodigie, had they but known that the ſame Vapours which compound the Clouds, might form Manna; and that it was as eaſie for the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God to nouriſh them with this meat, as to nouriſh all the people of the earth with Rain and Dew. They had certainly reſerved their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment for the Euchariſt, had they had the knowledge of our myſteries: For indeed, it is the ſtrangeſt and moſt glorious: it ſeems the Son of God hath drained his power in producing it; and recollecting all the miracles of his life, would ſum them up in this ſtupendious Sacrament: He makes uſe of the mouth of a man to exhibit a God; he will have a tranſient and periſhable word produce the Eternal and Divine Word; he will, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the laws of Nature, that the Accidents ſubſiſt without their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that the Subſtance of the Bread and Wine, being turned into that of his Body and Blood, keep notwithſtanding its Colour, Taſte, and Form: He is multiplied without being divided, to ſatisfie the love of his Spouſe; and admitting his Humanity into the priviledges of the Divinity, filleth his State with his preſence. We are in a doubt whether he does not work a Miracle for the Faithful which is not indulged the Bleſſed; and we are yet ignorant whether this divine multiplication be an effect of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or of his power. For though there are ſome Divines who believe that glorified bodies may be in divers places without a miracle, and that the part they have in the Immenſity of God multiplies their bodies without dividing them; the Schools have always lookt upon this effect as a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, and have taught us that the order of Glory had its Miracles as well as that of Nature and Grace.</p>

Damaſc.</note> had a minde in this Myſtery to repeat all the Miracles he had wrought during the courſe of his life: For if he were born of <hi>Mary</hi> without intereſſing her Virginity; if, making her a Mother, he left her a Virgin; if the Fruit ſhe bare deflowred not her Purity; he is produced in our Sacrifices without violating their Accidents; and changing their ſubſtance into his, alters not the Species that cover them: If he turn wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine at a Marriage in <hi>Cana,</hi> and manifeſt himſelf the Maſter of the Elements in changing their qualies; he appears no leſs abſolute in a Sacrament, where he turns the Bread into his Body, the Wine into his Blood, and the Creature into his Creator: If he multiply the loaves in the wilderneſs, and operate this prodigie by the hands of his Apoſtles,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115672:145"/>they being ignorant of the manner; he daily multiplies his Body by the hands of the Prieſts, who cannot comprehend a miracle whereof they are the witneſſes and the Miniſters: If heretofore he cured the ſick that came unto him, here he cures the diſeaſed that receive him; and if he raiſed the dead by his touch or by his Word, here he promiſeth life to all thoſe that feed upon him, and engageth himſelf by a promiſe as ſure as an Oracle, that he will draw all thoſe out of the grave that have ſerved him here for a Temple. Thus this adorable Sacrament deſerves the name of Manna, better then Manna it ſelf, and ought no leſs to fill our hearts with aſtoniſhment then with love.</p>
                  <p>But to continue our reſemblances, and to manifeſt the truth in the figure; The Pſalmiſt hath obſerved, that Manna was not a bare Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a preſervative and a remedy. For while the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made uſe of it in the Deſarts, they were never moleſted with any infirmities; Though they ſo often changed their Quarters, marched through a Wilderneſs where the want of water, and the multitude of ſerpents might make them fear an infection; nevertheleſs, this food which participated of the Tree of Life, and made them taſte in the Deſarts the delights of Paradiſe, ſo well ſuited with their temper, that though they daily beheld rebels in their Camp, they never ſaw any ſick: <hi>In Tribubus eorum non erat infirmus.</hi> There by a ſtrange prodigy, diſeaſes were not the harbingers of death: they gave up the ghoſt without any pangs; ſome ſmall weakneſs gave them notice of the houre of their departure; the ſoul fairly took leave of the body, and the Feaver which ſeems the forrager of death, durſt not ſet upon men whom Manna ſerved for nouriſhment. The Euchariſt works the ſame miracle in our ſouls, that this Heavenly food did in their bodies; It is at the ſame time diet and an Antidote; it gives life and preſerves it; it delivers us from evil, and then protects us againſt it; it maintains the conſtitution of the ſoul in a regulated evenneſs of temper, and much happier then phyſick, which cannot tame the diſeaſe without weakning nature; it deals ſo critically with the ſins, that it never preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diceth the ſinner. Many times when Faith ſeconds Piety, this Celeſtial viand extends its effects as far as the body; it maintains health as well as ſalvation, and cures the diſeaſed as well as the wicked: In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church it wrought wonderful cures, and the great Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> tels us, that Phyſitians were uſeleſs in thoſe days, becauſe Chriſtians found their cure in the Euchariſt, and proved there was the ſame Jeſus preſent, whoſe Word was heretofore ſo fatal to infirmities, and ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the infirm.</p>
                  <p>If in this particular it ſupaſs Manna, in another it equals it,

                        </gap>ph.</note> becauſe in reſtoring health it infuſed ſtrength, and inſpired courage; For there are ſome Writers that are of opinion, that the valour of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> was an effect of Manna; that they owed thoſe formidable victories they gained from their enemies, to this meat that came down from Heaven.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115672:146"/>Neither ought this to ſeem ſtrange to the incredulous, ſince experience teacheth us, that wine which is the pure work of Nature, produceth dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame effects; drowns fear in its vapours; inſpires men with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of dangers; gives a new vigour to ſoldiers, and conſtitutes the beſt part of their courage. Therefore I am eaſily perſwaded to believe, that Manna wrought the ſame wonder in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whileſt nouriſhing their body, it maintained their valour: and making them ſound and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, made them withall magnanimous and valiant. Indeed, inaſmuch as this food was more miraculous then natural, and acted rather by the directions of Heaven, then the properties of its own nature, it loſt this faculty aſſoon as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> loſt grace: and as if it had changed qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity when they changed diſpoſition, it produced fear in the ſame hearts where it had formerly produced courage and aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>All theſe wonders were but the ſhadows of what we adore in the Euchariſt, which is not only the food but the force of the Chriſtian; we come from the Altar as Lions terrifying the Infernal Spirits, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure our ſight; the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt wherewith we are ſurrounded, ſtartles them into a diſorder: and remembring that we bear about us the ſame ſleſh and bloud which triumphed over them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> they dare not ſet upon us; They flie ſuch men who lodge a god in their ſouls, and beholding their Judge ſeated in our hearts as upon his Throne, they are afraid leſt he pronounce ſentence againſt them, re-doubling their pains, and aggravating their torments. It was this Heavenly Bread that animated the Martyrs to the combat; this adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Bread that gave them courage to daunt their executioners; and the ſword of <hi>Gideon</hi> that won ſo many victories, was but the Type of this; For this mighty man entring the Camp of the <hi>Madianites,</hi> and hearing one of their ſoldiers tell his fellow, that in his ſleep he ſaw a Cake fall from Heaven, which routed their army; he perſwaded himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all appearance,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sicut verbum Dei cibus eſt &amp; gladius, ita &amp; corpus ejus.</hi> Ber.</note> that this Cake was his Sword: and taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from this dream, ſet upon his enemies and defeated them; <hi>Non eſt hoc aliud niſi gladius Gideonis.</hi> But 'tis very true, that the Bread of Jeſus Chriſt is the Sword of the Chriſtians; the ſame meat that nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth them, defends them; and the ſame remedy that cures their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, ſubdues their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Its ſtrength no way hinders its ſweetneſs, and like Manna there are charms in it, that make it pleaſing to every palate; For the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture aſſures us, that this Heavenly food was fitted to the appetite of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> that never changing the faſhion, it altered the ſavour, and following their inclinations, complied with their taſts to ſatisfie their longing. I know Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is of opinion, that this mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was wrought onely in favour of the righteous, and that the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were deprived of a Grace, which in ſtead of heightning their devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did only whet their ſtomack: But the Scripture declares this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115672:146"/>and the words thereof, which are as true as Oracles, inform us, that Manna, beſides its natural taſte, had other relliſhes according to the ſeveral appetites of thoſe that gathered it.</p>
                  <p>If the Figure were thus advantageous for the body, the Subſtance is much more beneficial for the ſoul: For inaſmuch as this Sacrament contains the ſource of Grace, there is none but may from thence be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto us; though its principal effect be to maintain life, it fails not to produce all Vertues, and to ſatisfie the inclinations of all thoſe that receive it: It inſpires Lovers with Charity, weak perſons with Courage, Virgins with Purity, Penitents with Sorrow: and becoming all things to all upon Earth as well as in Heaven, perfectly fulfils all the deſires of the Faithful; By its abundance it ſupplies all other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: It gives us Jeſus Chriſt in all his different relations; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending as well his Myſteries as their Graces, makes us enjoy him living and dying, humble and glorified, acting and ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>For whether Eternity which in one indiviſible moment includes all the differences of time, recollect here all the Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt; or whether this Sacrament comprehend all that it exhibits, and being the Figure and Truth both together, preſents us the Death and Reſurrection of the Son of God, becauſe it is the Sacrament thereof; or finally, whether Jeſus Chriſt upon the Altars, to comfort the Faithful, who ſaw him not upon the Earth, will by a miraculous way for their ſakes, accord the preſent with the paſt, and let himſelf be enjoyed after his Death, as he was ſeen before his Birth; he gives himſelfe wholly to them in this Myſtery, and fully communicates all that he is, all that he hath done, and all that he hath ſuffered for their ſalvation: ſo that ſimple ſouls may conſider him there as a child; <hi>Hermites</hi> as ſolitary; the Evangeliſts as a Divine Preacher; the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs as a Sacrifice; the Prelates as a Paſtor:

                  <p>THe Divine Providence is never more wonderful, then when it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the ſame means to ſave us, the malice of the Devil had made uſe of to deſtroy us. Thus let us magnifie his Oeconomy when we ſee our ſalvation ſomewhat reſemble our fall, and the ſame things that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved us in tranſgreſſion, deliver us out of it. A Devil jealous of our happineſs, began our miſery; a Woman, too eaſily liſtened to his words; a man over-lightly complacent, ſuffered himſelf to be cajoled by her: and the beauty of the forbidden fruit charming his eyes, ſeduced his mind and corrupted his will. The Divine Wiſdome imitating our fall in the work of our ſalvation, made uſe of an Angel the Interpreter of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; of a Virgin true to his Promiſes; of a Man-God, that ſatisfied his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and of a fruit not forbidden, but commanded, which really exhibits to the Chriſtian all thoſe advantages man was made to hope for in his Innocence. For the Devil conſidering the juſt inclinations Nature and Grace had imprinted in the ſoul of man, to ſeduce him, promiſed him that if he would diſobey God, he ſhould find his happineſs in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: and that the uſe of the fruit he was forbidden to meddle with, ſhould make him Immortal, knowing Good and Evil; and Chriſtian Religion teacheth us, that the Body of the Son of God received in the Sacrament, with piety due to ſo great love, produceth in us theſe effects: and making us Men-Gods, makes us Knowing and Immortal. Let us examine theſe Promiſes, and ſee what we ought to expect from the God of Truth, and the Father of Lyes.</p>
                  <p>If the fear of death, and the deſire of life, be not the moſt ancient paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of man, we may affirm them the moſt natural and moſt violent; He hath an apprehenſion of death, before he knows what it is; he deſires Immortality, before he believes it: and whatever he does here below, is only by defending himſelf from a diſſolution, to live for ever. Every one ſeeks after the ſame end, though by different mediums; and he that would put the queſtion to each particular, would learn by their anſwers, that they labour only to become Immortal. Fathers mary not ſo much for the pleaſure of the bed, as for the deſire they have to ſurvive in their
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115672:147"/>poſterity; and, in ſpight of death, gain a perpetuity to their Being as well as their Name. Philoſophers are not ſo much in love with Knowledge and Vanity, as with Life; whilſt they ſpend whole nights in their books, and leave the productions of their brain to poſterity: For they think to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen death by this ſtratagem; they believe their reputation will pierce the Generations to come; and that, living in the memory of men, they ſhall in ſome ſort enjoy Immortality. Monarchs, whoſe minde and body are equally barren, leaving neither Children nor Vertues behinde them, whereby they may be known to their Succeſſors, raiſe Pyramids to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their memory; and being not able to buſie the Pen of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, employ the Tool of the Engraver; and ſtamp their name upon Marble, being unable to write it in the Annals. Conquerors are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from this madneſs; they fight onely to get themſelves a Name, ſeek for Life in the very boſome of Death, depopulate States, to make ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages talk of them; deſtroy Towns to raiſe Trophies; and,

From this Paſſion doth <hi>Tertullian</hi> draw arguments to prove the immortality of the ſoul; and to perſwade the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels that whole man dies not, becauſe he extends his deſires beyond this life: and knowing very well that his ſpirit muſt ſurvive his body, is much troubled how he may preſerve his reputation after his death.</p>
                  <p>The Devil, who is not ignorant that this deſire is engraved in our hearts by the finger of Nature, and that it is eaſier to divert it then ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it, try'd to make uſe of it in Paradiſe, to ſeduce the firſt man: he went not about to take from him the belief of the immortality of his ſoul; he knew, a minde ſo enlightned could not be clouded with ſuch darkneſs; but he perſwaded him that his happineſs depended upon his diſobedience, and that, to defend him from death, wherewith God had threatned him, his onely way was to eat of the forbidden fruit. This ſubtil ſpirit would not ſet upon man till he had ſtirred up the moſt violent of his Paſſions; and he conceived it an eaſie matter to ruine him, if he could but perſwade him that Immortality would be the recompence of his crime: Indeed, Man, charmed with ſo fair a promiſe, violated the reſpect he owed his God; he reached his hand to that fatal Tree, and plucking the fruit which ſerved for a proof his obedience, made himſelf guilty of ſin and obnoxious to death.</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as the Son of God takes pleaſure to draw our Salvation out of our Fall, and makes us, in a blinde ſubmiſſion, finde that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we ſought for in a fooliſh credulity; he hath inſtituted a Sacrament in his Church which contains an admirable fruit, giving thoſe that eat of it a happie Immortality. For the chief effect of this celeſtial food, is, to preſerve us from death, and aſſure us of life: <hi>He that eateth my fleſh,</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>ſhall live for ever:</hi> He oppoſeth this nouriſhment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that of the fathers in the wilderneſs; and proteſting that thoſe that eat his fleſh ſhall never die, he engageth himſelf, by a ſolemn promiſe, to
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115672:148"/>raiſe them from the dead: So that though his Juſtice did not oblige him to raiſe the Innocent and the Guilty out of the grave to give them their reward, his Truth would oblige him to reſtore life to the Faithful, who in obedience to his will have eaten this ever-to-be-adored Fruit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that the Fathers of the Church, making the Elogie of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, call it ſometimes the Earneſt of glory, ſometimes the Antidote of death, ſometimes the Seed of immortality: But becauſe the devil joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the deſire of Glory with that of Life, and promiſed man to make him a god if he would eat of the Forbidden fruit; Jeſus Chriſt takes the ſame courſe; and having made us hope for immortality in this Sacrament, he raiſeth our expectation, and promiſeth us Divinity.</p>
                  <p>I do not wonder that Innocent man deſired to be God,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>His loſs had been irrecoverable, had not the Son of God found out a remedy, and, obliging him to taſte a Divine Fruit in the Euchariſt, had not repaired his fault, and ſatisfied his deſire. For it was not enough to cure Man of his ſin by a Sacrament, if the Divine Mercy had not furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at the ſame time with a means innocently to content his longings. The inclination to Divinity was riveted in the very bottom of his Eſſence; and I dare ſay, the perſwaſion of the Serpent, very far from defacing it, had rooted it faſter: Man had a minde to command: though he had loſt the power, he ſtill retained the deſire; and as there is no miſerable man that would not with all his heart be happie, neither is there any ſinner that would not raign with God.</p>
                  <p>This wiſh was a Sacriledge, and an attempt againſt the Godhead; but by the goodneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, it is become an act of Religion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For this Son, who is equal to his Father, and who, being his primitive Image, and the Character of his Subſtance, hath the right of exalting men to this dignity, was made Man in the Incarnation, that they might be made Gods in the Euchariſt; and was laden with their Miſeries
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115672:148"/>in the One, that they might be cloathed with his Glory in the Other. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, 'tis in this ineffable Myſtery wherein Man mingles himſelf with God; where, by a holy confuſion, he loſeth his bad qualities, and aſſumes divine ones; where, leaving off to be a ſinner, he begins to be innocent; where, ſoaring above himſelf, he enters into the rights of God.

                  </p>
                  <p>There it is that the Euchariſt ſupplies the myſtery of the Incarnation: For this made onely a Man-God, included its effects in one Individual of Nature; the holy Humanity enjoyed this favour all alone; and if men received any advantage, it was rather honourable then uſeful. This Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was like thoſe Marriages where all the profit is the Brides, and the glory onely the Kinreds: 'Twas indeed a happineſs for men, that their nature was preferred before that of the Angels, and that God, intending to be allied to his Creatures, vouchſafed to make himſelf a Man, and not a Seraphim: But had not this myſtery been attended with other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, and had not the holy Sacrament been added to the Incarnation, the Man-God had not communicated to us his qualities; and remaining ſtill the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> we had never been made the children of God: This great effect was reſerved for the Euchariſt; 'tis in this myſtery that whole Nature was Deified; and we may ſay, that if the Communication of the Word in the Incarnation was infinite, it was not immenſe but in the holy Sacrament of the Altar. There it is that we become Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out committing a crime; there Piety ſatisfies our Ambition: there the union we contract with the Word, imitates and honours That it contracted with the Father from all Eternity. Finally, there it is that the onely Son becomes the firſt-born; and taking us for his Brethren, makes us the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and withal the Images of his Father.</p>
                  <p>After this great advantage, 'tis not hard to conceive that he was willing to content our third deſire; and having made us Gods, hath indued us with Knowledge, to beſtow upon us in earneſt what the devil promiſed us in jeſt. For this Spirit, who ſtill retains ſo much light amidſt the thickneſs of his darkneſs, perceiving that the deſire of Knowledge is one of the ſtrongeſt Paſſions of Man, perſwaded him that God had not forbidden him the uſe of the fruit he adviſed him to eat, but to keep him in ignorance, and to deprive him of thoſe innocent pleaſures Science brings with it into the minde. This temptation proved ſo powerful, that it prevailed upon man for his conſent; and he that had reſiſted the promiſes of Glory and Life, ſuffered himſelf to be charmed with the hope of Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, we muſt confeſs, that of all the Paſſions this is the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: Beaſts are moved with the love of Life and Glory; they fear Death and Diſhonour: They fight, to be ſecured from both theſe; and thoſe that are accounted the nobleſt, are as ambitious in their victories of the increaſe of their reputation, as of the preſervation of their life: But the deſire of Knowledge is peculiar to Man: there is no creature but he, that takes pains to be delivered from Ignorance: His combats for Glory
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115672:149"/>are not more famous then his diſputes for Truth; and Conquerors take leſs pleaſure to gain Slaves, then Philoſophers do to purchaſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>
                  <p>The conteſtation of Wits is nobler then that of Bodies: and if there be any conflict among the Angels, it more reſembles that of Philoſophers then that of Conquerors: The Underſtanding and the Will are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Atms made uſe of, either for offence or defence: whole Nature is the Field; the differences ſpring not from the divers intereſts of Soveraigns, but from the contrary opinions of Maſters: the recompence of the Victors is not ſo much the Conqueſt of Glory, as of Knowledge: they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ſatisfied with their advantage, then when of their Enemies they make their Partiſans; and delivering them from Errour and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, enrich them with Knowledge and Truth. Therefore did the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil make uſe of this ſtratagem to gain man to his ſide; and believed that if any thing in the world would make him forget his duty, 'twas his deſire to Know Good and Evil. In the mean time, Man loſt his Light by loſing his Innocence; the father of Lyes plunged him in darkneſs; and, falling into the pit of Sin, by a juſt judgement he fell into the abyſs of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>But Jeſus Chriſt, all whoſe Promiſes are Truth, opens the eyes of the ſoul to the Faithful that receive his Body: he enlightens their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and warms their Will; he manifeſts himſelf to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in this Sacrament; and leading them to Knowledge by the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Faith, may be ſaid to give them ſight, by making them blinde. 'Tis in the breaking of this Bread, that his diſciples know him; 'tis by the vertue of this Drink, that the ſcales are taken from their eyes; and 'tis by the Grace of this Food, that the Juſt, who are nouriſhed therewith, receive Underſtanding together with Life. If Jeſus Chriſt raign upon our Altars as a Soveraign, he inſtructs thence as a Maſter: if we are his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in that condition, we are alſo his Diſciples; and if he gives us Laws to regulate us, he gives us Counſels to inform us. From all this Diſcourſe 'tis eaſie to infer, that Jeſus Chriſt is the God of Truth, and the Devil the Father of Lyes; That the One, promiſing us Honour, Knowledge, and Life, involved us in Shame, Ignorance and Death; the Other, giving us his Body, made us Wiſe, Immortal, and Glorious.</p>

                  <head>The Fifth DISCOURSE. <hi>That this Nouriſhment unites the Chriſtian with the Son of God.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>INaſmuch as Unity is the moſt excellent perfection of God, all the works of his hands bear the Character thereof; there is no creature that in his compoſition maintains not this advantage; he ceaſeth to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt or live, aſſoon as he begins to be divided; and if S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> judged rightly, that grief was nothing but the diviſion of the ſoul, we may ſay that death is nothing but the diſſolution of the body. Thence it comes to paſs, that God, in Nature and in Grace, that he may preſerve his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, maintains them in unity, and makes his nobleſt operations and his higheſt myſteries ſerviceable to this deſign. His Providence that guides the Univerſe, takes no other care but to aſſociate the creatures together, that their union may compoſe the worlds Harmony: As the Battles of Princes tend to peace, the jar of the Elements wrangles out a concord; if they recede from their contraries, 'tis to embrace their like; and when they ſeem moſt incenſed, they intend not ſo much a mutual deſtruction, as to remove thoſe obſtacles that hinder their alliance.</p>
                  <p>That which is done in Nature, is effected in Grace; all the operations thereof, mean only to reconcile us to God;
<note place="margin">

All our Myſteries, and all our Sacraments, ſeek the ſame end by different ways. Baptiſm unites us to Jeſus Chriſt, as to our Head; Repentance, as to our Surety; the Euchariſt, as to our Beloved, becauſe compleating all the other unions, it happily converts us into him that nouriſheth us with his Fleſh and Bloud.</p>
                  <p>This deſign hath excellently appeared in the choice he made of the matter of this Sacrament. For the Bread, whoſe ſubſtance is changed into that of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is made up of many grains of corn, which being kneaded and baked together, compoſeth that Sacrifice which is offered upon our Altars: The Wine, whoſe ſubſtance is turned into the Bloud of Chriſt, is compounded of many Grapes, which being trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the ſame Preſs, ſends forth that juice which is exhibited in this oblation: So that the Son of God prepares the heart of the Faithful by a ſenſible union to a ſpiritual one; and teacheth them, that he will unite them with him in a Sacrament, whoſe outward appearances breathe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but unity.</p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:115672:150"/>
                  <p>The Fleſh which the outward ſpecies cover, is ſo one, that its multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication cannot divide it: it is produced in a thouſand places to re-unite thoſe that receive it; and contrary to that of <hi>Adam,</hi> is one in its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Omne bellum oritur ex carne; homo enim ſi carnalis non eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, nunquam cum alio homine pugnaret.</hi> Aug.</note> as well as in its effects. For the fleſh of our firſt Father is a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unhappy ſpring of diviſion; it is parted into as many bodies as there are children: and we may ſay, that all men are the wretched por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this guilty fleſh. The ſouls are divided with it to inanimate it; and acting by its Organs, contract its bad qualities, whence ariſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and diſputes that diſtract States and Fam lies: But the moſt Tragical diviſion is, that being the channel of ſin, it makes the ſouls guilty aſſoon as they touch it, and ſeparate them from God by an offence which was free in the firſt man, and natural in all his poſterity: For 'tis enough that they are blended with the fleſh of <hi>Adam,</hi> to make them become guilty. 'Tis from this unhappy mixture that thoſe fatal rents iſſue and proceed, which occaſion all our diſaſters; and if we did not communicate in fleſh with <hi>Adam,</hi> we ſhould not partake of his ſin, nor be liable to his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But this of Jeſus Chriſt more happy and more innocent then his, heals our diviſion, and leads us to unity; it is one in ſubſtance; and though a part of <hi>Adams,</hi> is exempt from all ſin, becauſe the work of the Holy Ghoſt, and the Word that ſuſtains it, renders it impeccable; He that communicates life to it, communicates innocence in ſo high a degree, that he imparts it to thoſe that receive it. Its multiplication diſſolves not the unity; the ſame Word that produceth it upon our Altars, gives it the impreſs of its qualities; and contrary to all the rules of nature, which cannot multiply things without dividing them, finds a ſecret to give it a Beeing in a thouſand places without impairing its unity.</p>
                  <p>There is this difference between Nature and a Word; the former is fruitful only by diviſion; 'tis wonderful how from a grain of corn ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts a whole Harveſt; pays the labour of the Husbandman with uſury; recompenſeth his pains with plenty; and imitating the power of her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which makes all things of nothing, makes a great deal of a very little. But ſhe cannot accord multiplication with unity; ſhe muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide whatever ſhe produceth: and her liberality is founded upon the fraction of her Preſents. A Word more powerful then nature, is brought forth without partition; it is communicated through the fulleſt Auditory without wronging its Unity; and though always one, fils the ears of all thoſe that are within the ſound of it.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that the Body of the Son of God, which produced by the Word,

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115672:150"/>they break it, they cannot divide it; but preſerving its unity in the fraction of the ſpecies, remains always the Numerical body of Jeſus Chriſt. Thence it comes to paſs, that it unites all the faithful that receive it; For though they be as different in conditions as generations; as contrary in humours as intereſts; as great ſtrangers in their inclinations as climates; they doe notwithſtanding make up one body, becauſe they are nouriſhed with one bread, and all eat the ſame meat; which having the power to aſſimilate the feeder into the food, communicates unto them a wonderful unity which compoſeth all their differences.</p>
                  <p>But to comprehend this laſt miracle, we muſt remember that this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and being of another nature then common meat, is not diſgeſted by the natural heat, nor converted into the ſubſtance of thoſe that take it; only the accidents that cover it reſent that injury, and yielding to that fire that animates and conſumes us, becomes a part of our ſelves: Being impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and glorified, 'tis free from corruption, acting upon thoſe that eat it, and having the ſame effect upon them, they have upon other nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, converts them miraculouſly into it ſelf. Thus every Chriſtian, if he bring not reſiſtance with him, becomes another Jeſus Chriſt; he parts with the bad qualities of <hi>Adam,</hi> to aſſume the glorious ones of the Son of God; if he ſhare not in his impaſſibility, he does in his innocence; if he become not immortal, he becomes in ſome ſort glorified; and if he change not nature, he alters at leaſt his inclination.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it that all the Fathers of the Church admiring the holy ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems Jeſus Chriſt makes uſe of to unite us to himſelf,
<note place="margin">

Indeed experience teacheth us, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and love have found out no better invention to convert Eſſences then Nutrition: Every day the meat we eat, is aſſimilated into our ſubſtance; the wine altering its qualities by a natural Chymiſtry, is turned into our bloud; bread without any other additional ſupplement then the natural heat, becomes our fleſh; and all the nouriſhments we take, by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful metamorphoſis paſs into our nature: The union they contract with us is ſo great, nothing can break it; all the endeavours of men cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it; and it is eaſier for the cruelty of the Executioner to bray the chains that faſten the ſoul to the body, then to unravel thoſe links that doe conſubſtantiate the food with him that hath diſgeſted it: Being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into his ſubſtance, and blended with all the parts that compoſe him, the inquiſition muſt ſearch for it in his Arteries, and break his very bones to extract it with the marrow.</p>
                  <p>Love alſo, that takes pleaſure to imitate nature, hath found out no more powerful means to unite lovers together, when one of them hath bid farewel to the world, then in making the dead ſerve for a nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the living; and to give him a reſurrection by an artifice which
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115672:151"/>can find no excuſe, but in the exceſſe of that paſſion that gave it a being. Thus we read that diſconſolate <hi>Artemiſia</hi> having loſt her dear <hi>Mauſolus,</hi>

Her grief ſpared nothing that might comfort an afflicted wife, in honouring the memory of ſo dearly a beloved husband; ſhe employed the moſt famous Orators of her time to ſweeten her ſorrows; and to make the Panegyrick of him ſhe had loſt, ſhe erected a ſtaely monument which paſſeth for one of the ſeven wonders of the world; and having not ſeen any Tomb that can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual its magnificence, gives a denomination to this day to thoſe of the the greateſt Monarchs of the Univerſe: But inaſmuch as nothing can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the extremity of love, and ordinary remedies doe but aggravate a violent ſorrow, this afflicted lover reſolved to drink the aſhes of her dead husband;

                  <p>Me thinks the Son of God compleated in the Euchariſt what love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged this amorous Princeſs to attempt: For being united to us in this Sacrament, and converting us into himſelf by the mighty working of his infinite Power, we may ſay he re-animates aſhes, becauſe he raiſeth the dead and converts ſinners: So that of all the alliances he hath contracted with us, we muſt needs acknowledge this the cloſeſt and moſt intimate. 'Twas certainly a great teſtimony of his love, when he was incarnate in the chaſt Womb of his Virgin Mother; and clothing himſelf with our fleſh, took upon him the burden of our ſins, and of the puniſhments due unto them: it was a conſequence of this love, when he vouchſafed to converſe with us, and treating us as his brethren, gave us part in the inheritance of his glory: It was a proof of his compaſſion, when he became our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to his Father; pleaded our Cauſe before his Throne; and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe an act of oblivion for all our tranſgreſſions, mingled his tears with his bloud in the garden of Olives: It was me thinks the utmoſt expreſſion of his love, when he became our Surety upon the Croſſe, loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf with our ſins to enrich us with his merits, and made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with us, which coſt him his life, and procured us ſalvation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs all theſe favours united him not with men, and when he was our Brother,

Tho.</note> our Advocate, our Surety, he was not one perſon with us: But in the Euchariſt, wherein he is our nouriſhment, his love hath found out the ſecret of incorporating us with him; he yet unites man with God; he repeats the Myſtery of the Incarnation; he does that in favour of all men, which he only did for Humanity; and he works a thouſand times one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in the Boſome of the Church, which he acted but once in the Womb of his Mother: For if we compare the Euchariſt with the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhall find that in the one, God is made Man; in the other, Men became Gods; In the one, he is united to our nature; in the other, to our perſon; in the one, he is inveſted with our miſeries; in the other, he apparels us with his greatneſs.</p>

                  <p>But becauſe in all theſe Alliances we meet not with that of Mother, he is willing that his body, conceived by the Virgin, ſhould be alſo produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Prieſts upon our Altars, that they might be his parents, and might boaſt that the Incarnation hath no preeminence above the Euchariſt. For the Scripture teacheth us that Jeſus Chriſt in his birth is the work of the holy Ghoſt, and of the Virgin; both theſe perſons became mutually pregnant: <hi>Mary</hi> reſtores to the holy Ghoſt what ſhe received from him; and when ſhe became the Mother of the Son of God, he became the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple: The ſame Jeſus in his Paſſion is the work of ſinners; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him to death by the mouth of <hi>Pilate,</hi> nail him to the Croſs by the hands of the Executioners, and deſpoil him of his honour and his life by the outrages of the Jews: In the Reſurrection he is the pure work of his Father; he it is that draws him from the grave, who gives him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his labours, exalts him to glory, and makes him raign ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly with him. But in the Euchariſt he is the work of the Prieſts; 'tis their word that makes him preſent upon our Altars; their intention, that makes him deſcend from heaven: in the name of all the Faithful, theſe are the powerful Miniſters that conceive him, and bring him forth, that this holy Sacrament may perfect all the Alliances the myſtery of the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had begun, and that we may have this conſolation, to know that there is no union in Nature we contract not with Jeſus Chriſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt.</p>

                  <p>IF it be a truth, that great benefits require great acknowledgements, we muſt confeſs that extraordinary Myſteries require extraordinary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; nor that they muſt otherwiſe be approacht unto, then with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence which is due to ſacred things: 'Tis a Sacriledge to have to do with them with a prophane ſpirit; and we do but expoſe our ſelves to the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation of heaven, when we think to partake of them without that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration their ſtupendious holineſs doth require. The Levites were not admitted to the ſervice of the Altar before they were purified: The High-Prieſt went not into the Sanctuary of the Temple, till he had expiated his ſins by the blood of a Sacrifice; neither did the Prophets deliver Oracles to the people, till the holy Spirit, who ſpake with their mouth, reſided in their heart. The Euchariſt therefore being the moſt auguſt of our Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115672:152"/>obligeth us to very great and reverential diſpoſitions: Each quality 'tis attended with, exacts a particular preparation; and all the titles it bears, demand of the receivers as many different vertues.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as it is the moſt hidden Myſtery of our Religion, whoſe wonders deceive our eyes, whoſe luſtre dazzles the ſunſhine of our neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt obſervation; the manner of Chriſts reſiding there being altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible to our Senſes, and unconceiveable to our Underſtandings, we are obliged to bring along with us much Faith, and little Reaſoning: a blinde obedience is a Sacrifice that muſt accompany this oblation of the Son of God upon our Altars; and at the ſame time that his Body is the Holocauſt of his Love, our Underſtanding muſt be the Victim of our Faith. 'Tis in this occaſion that we ought to relie upon the Power and Truth of him that worketh this Miracle; and examining the difficulties that combat our Faith, we are onely to conſider that he that hath drawn All things out of Nothing, is ſtill able to extract his Body out of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Bread,

Manna had qualities expreſſing thoſe of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt: The Law, though obſcure, was an expoſition of the Goſpel, and, rightly underſtood, obliged us to love God above all things, and our Neighbour as our ſelves. The Sea, which favoured their retreat in parting aſunder, and coming together again ſwallowed up the Egyptians, darted forth ſome glimmerings of light amidſt theſe ſhades of darkneſs, and by ſenſible effects exhibited what was to be acted upon our ſouls in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm. The Land of Promiſe had ſome reſemblance with that of the Living; its plenty was an image of the felicity of heaven, where nothing is wanting to the bleſſed inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs we muſt acknowledge that the pledges we receive in the New Teſtament, are far more certain and ſubſtantial: They exhibit the beſt part of what they promiſe, they do what they make ſhew of; and joyning the Figure with the Subſtance, we may ſay, that, without depriving us of the quality of the Faithful, they procure us that of the Bleſſed. Baptiſm, which raiſeth us to the dignity of the Sons of God, gives us admittance into his Inheritance; we are already new creatures; and though not yet perfected by Glory, are notwithſtanding begun to be wrought upon by Grace. We are the members of Jeſus Chriſt, though we remain the members of <hi>Adam:</hi> if the Charity the holy Ghoſt hath ſhed abroad in our hearts quench not Concupiſcence, at leaſt it aboliſheth the ſin; and though our righteouſneſs be imperfect, it fails not to be true. The Incarnation raiſeth our hopes; and having ſeen a God made Man in being born of a Virgin, we have not much ado to believe that Men may become Gods in being born of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But not to enter upon a deduction which would lead too far from the Subject of my diſcourſe, we need onely conſider the Euchariſt, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this Verity: It is a pledge wherein God performs what he promiſeth: 'Tis part of that ſum he bids us hope for,

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:115672:153"/>it effected: our enjoyment ought to produce our yearning after it: All Chriſtians muſt be like <hi>Daniel,</hi> men of deſires; and renouncing the things of the world, fix all their pretenſions towards heaven. This Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that unites them to Jeſus Chriſt, muſt raiſe them as high as God; and when his preſence is vaniſhed with the ſpecies, the deſires that Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with, muſt give them another relliſh of what the natural heat hath made them loſe by digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition prepares us for another more noble and more holy: For if we are to expreſs our longings becauſe the Body of the Son of God is a pledge of his Promiſes, we ought to be indued with Love and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, becauſe this Sacrament is a Marriage of his ſoul with ours: Baptiſm is the Beginning, and the Euchariſt the Conſummation hereof: we have engaged our word when we were admitted into the Church; and receiving the character of our ſervitude, we have given bond for our Faithfulneſs. But in the Myſtery of the Euchariſt he deals with our ſouls as with his Spouſe; we become fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone; he enters into our boſome, and we into his: his body and ours are animated with the ſame Spirit; and partaking in all the qualities of our Beloved, we have right to his moſt glorious priviledges.</p>
                  <p>But ſo noble an Alliance requires a great affection, and much fidelity: This Lover is jealous; he will raign alone in the hearts that he poſſeſſeth: as he cannot endure a Competitor in his State, ſo neither can he a Rival in his Love: he will have nothing loved but for his ſake: and becauſe our adheſion to the Creature is not without imperfections, he never beholds it without grief, nor leaves it without puniſhment. Whatever is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to Fidelity, diſpleaſeth: he never breaks his word, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure we ſhould fail of our duty: He will keep what he hath once gotten: and ſeeing his Power is equal to his Love, he is as ſevere in his Revenge, as he is liberal in his Favours When I conſider the obligations we have to his Goodneſs, I never wonder that his Juſtice corrects us; but I am aſhamed there ſhould be any ſouls ſo negligently careleſs as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him; and that, after ſo many favours, any ſhould be ſo wretched as to betray their duty, and abandon Jeſus Chriſt. Nevertheleſs this crime is ſo common among Chriſtians, that thoſe who will not break their word with an Enemy, take no care to be true to the Son of God, baſely deſert his party, lodge the devil in the ſame Throne where they had ſeated their Soveraign, and take an Adulterer into the bed from whence they have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their lawful Husband.</p>
                  <p>If the remembrance of his favours cannot produce love in our ſouls, the terrour of puniſhments muſt beget Fear: For if he be our Beloved in the Euchariſt, he is alſo our Judge; and having fruitleſly exhibited teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his Goodneſs,

                  <head>The Seventh DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Chriſtian owes God the Honour of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SAcrifice is the moſt ancient duty of the creature towards his Creator; It is the ſoul of Religion, precedes affection; and before man can be obliged to love God, he is bound to offer him a Sacrifice: For love preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome ſociety between God and man, which is not ſo much an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Nature as of Grace; but Sacrifice ſuppoſeth nothing but depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, which is inſeparable from the creature, and engageth him aſſoon as ever he proceeded out of Nothing, to acknowledge his Original by a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn homage. From hence may be inferred, that Sacrifice is an honour can be rendred only to God, and that 'tis changed into Sacriledge when offered to a meer creature.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this hard to be conceived, if we conſider the divers motives we have to offer Sacrifices to God, ſince ſin hath corrupted nature. The
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115672:154"/>firſt is, to reconcile us to him, and to mitigate his anger by the merit of the victime; The ſecond is to be united to him, knowing very well that as his Indignation is the ſoucre of all our evils, his Grace is the fountain-Head of all our good; whence it came to paſs, that in the Old Teſtament there were peace-offerings offered to him for the ſalvation of ſinners, which teſtified by their dying mouths, that to be removed from God was to be miſerable: The third is to obtain eternal glory, which makes us find our happineſs in the union it procures us with God, and deſtroying whatever we had of mortal or periſhable, happily transforms us into him;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Holocauſtum dicitur ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium cum totu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accenditur, quandò totum ardet &amp; totum abſumitur igne divino.</hi> Aug.</note> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were Holocauſts immolated, wherein the oblation wholly conſumed by the flame, figured out this Truth; and by a ſilent language taught us, that man ſhould never be happy till he was deſpoiled of all his corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he might be perfectly conſummated in God. Now all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God only can beſtow Grace, remit ſins which brave his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſanctifie ſouls in uniting them to himſelf, and glorifie them by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating to them his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Therefore by a neceſſary conſequence, they acknowledge, that as from him only theſe favours are to be obtained, we have no other way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for them, but by ſacrifice. The Law puniſhed thoſe with death that erected Altars to ſtrange gods, and offered thoſe honours to vain idols, which could not be ſafely given to true men: Nature her ſelf, though never ſo blind, ſacrificeth to none but thoſe ſhe conceives at leaſt to be Gods; and ſin being not able to quench all her lights, ſhe retains this belief in her errour, that Divinity only deſerves the honours of ſacrifice: Faith confirms this Truth, and ſtrongly perſwades us, that if the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture adores not his Creator, he is miſerable; and if he encroach upon the honour due to him, he becomes guilty.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Creatura ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis ſi non colit Deum, miſera eſt, quia priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Deo; ſi colit Deum, non vult ſe coli pro Deo.</hi> Aug.</note> Sacrifice then is a divine worſhip, whereby a reaſonable creature honours his Creator, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely profeſſeth, that as he hath received being from him, 'tis from him likewiſe that he expects felicity. But though there is nothing in God which being God himſelf deſerves not this homage, and all his perfections may juſtly require it; we muſt confeſs nevertheleſs there are three that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to this duty, and which in the ſtate of innocence as wel as ſin, demand this ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the Soveraignty he hath over his creature: For he depends of him in Creation and Preſervation; He had no right to exiſt before he iſſued from Nothing; in theſe profound abyſſes he could not ſo much as deſire or ask any thing; and being not yet in nature, could have no pretenſions of aſpiring either to Grace or Glory. Being now reduced from Non-Entity, he depends ſtill upon his Soveraign; he could not be able to ſubſiſt one moment, without aſſiſtance from him; he cannot act but by his impulſes; and though he be free in his operations, he that gave him being muſt give him motion: his preſervation is a conſequence of his Creation: the ſame power that produced him, preſerves him; and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115672:155"/>unleſs he be ſtrangely impudent, he muſt confeſs he depends not leſs upon God in his Entity, then in his Non-Entity. There is no need that the Earth ſhould open under his feet to ſwallow him up; that thunder ſhould fall upon his head to cruſh him to aſhes; nor that the waters ſhould flow from their couch to drown him: God needs only withdraw his hand, and he periſheth; let him but ceaſe to preſerve, and he moulders into annihilation. Dependency therefore and ſervitude conſtitute one part of his Eſſence: he is a ſlave aſſoon as a creature; and though God be Almighty, we may ſay, without offence, he can produce neither man nor Angel able to ſupport themſelves without him; and who in the progreſs as well as beginning of his life, depends not abſolutely upon his All-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.</p>
                  <p>This is it that obligeth both of them in their Creation to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to him; 'twas their firſt reflexion towards their Principle, their firſt duty towards their Soveraign, and their primitive inclination towards their laſt end: If they do not acquit themſelves, 'tis their fault; if dazled with their own light, and charmed with their own beauty, they fail of this their lawfull homage, they need ſeek no other cauſe of their crime, nor of their fall. I pretend not to expreſſe the nature of this ſacrifice, becauſe it is unkown to us; but I will ſay thus much, thatthe Angels being pure ſpirits, ſeek not oblations out of their own perſon; they ſtoop before the Almighty at the preſence of his greatneſs; they offer him what they are bound to by Creation, and refuſe not to ſubmit to him by the motion of their proper will, as they did from all Eternity in their nature.</p>
                  <p>For men, there is great likelihood, being compounded of a body and a ſoul, they would joyn external ſacrifice to internal; and to the end they might offer all they had received, preſenting him an Holocauſt of their perſon, they would employ their mouths to praiſe him, and their hands to ſerve him, having made uſe of their underſtandings to know him, and their wils to love him: we might believe alſo that acknowledging all the goods of the Earth the effects of his bounty, they would bring preſents and victimes of them; that returning his Soveraignty what they had received from his mercy, they would ſprinkle his Altars with wine, load them with fruits, and deck them with flowers.</p>
                  <p>But there is a queſtion, whether to ſatisfie their piety they would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their cruelty upon Animals: whether they would butcher thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent victimes; ſhed their bloud upon the Earth, and in that happy ſtate commit murders, that they might offer ſacrifices? Some are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that man living only upon fruits, ſlaughtered no victimes; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not as yet deſerved death, he would not make them bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſin; and being content to offer their Wool or their Milk, he honoured God, and did not deprive them of life: Others conceive, they ſlew theſe innocent Beaſts, not to pacifie the Juſtice of God, who was not as yet offended, but to adore his Soveraignty, and publickly to
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115672:155"/>profeſs, that expecting no ſin, he might binde Man over to death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it of him not as a Puniſhment, but as a Sacrifice. The Scripture ſeems to favour this opinion; and the skins wherewith our firſt parents were cloathed after their tranſgreſſion, make us ſuſpect they had ſacrificed ſome Animals during the ſtate of Innocence, and that the Supremacie of the Almighty imitating his Juſtice, was content that Man ſacrificed them in ſtead of himſelf. But not to engage in the ſearch of a Truth which lies buried in darkneſs and oblivion, 'tis enough to know, that Sacrifice is a publike acknowledgement of Gods Soveraign power, and that this was the firſt motive that invited Man to offer him Oblations.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is taken from his Holineſs,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sanctum &amp; terribile nomen ejus.</hi> Pſal. 110.</note> which is one of the nobleſt and leaſt known of all his perfections. The Scripture never ſpeaks of it but with reſpect; and mixing admiration always with this attribute, teacheth us that we are to magnifie it rather by our ſilence then by our words: The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in their eternal Hallelujahs are taken up onely with this adorable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. They forget as it were his Power that drew them out of Nothing, his Providence that guided them while they walked in the way of Merit, his Mercy that fortified them in their conflict, his Juſtice that crowned them in the victory, to think onely upon his Holineſs,
<note place="margin">

Indeed, it is the Seat of the Almighty; and if it be true, according to the opinion of the Fathers, that his Eſſence was his Habitation, we may ſay that his Holineſs is his Throne, and place of reſt. For all the other perfections, more ſollicitous after our advantage then his glory, oblige him to apply himſelf to our neceſſities: His Power marcheth forth to ſeek us in the Abyſſes of Non-entity; his Mercy delivers us from our Miſeries; his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pardons our Offences; and if his Juſtice that puniſheth us ſeem to eſpouſe his intereſts, it preſently forgets them, becauſe, having revenged them, it ſtudies to recompenſe our deſervings: But Holineſs,
<note place="margin">

                     </note> it ſtudies to recompenſe our deſervings: But Holineſs, more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Glory of God then the Salvation of Man, ſeparates him from all things, ſhuts him up in himſelf, and ſurrounds him with ſuch a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Majeſtie, that his Creatures dare not approach unto him: He reſts in this ever-to-be-worſhipped Throne more holily then in thoſe bleſſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who, borrowing their name from their properties, or from their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are called the living Thrones of the Divine Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Sacrifices then are immolated upon Altars, to adore this ineffable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: They periſh by the knife, or by the flame, to teſtifie that God is not at all faſtned to his Creatures, that the nobleſt are unworthy to come into his preſence, and that, approaching before him, he muſt deſtroy them, becauſe there is nothing deſerves to be offered up unto him. 'Twas in this humble and true ſenſe of the Divine Majeſtie, that the moſt innocent of all Sacrifices bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt: In this apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Jeſus Chriſt, adoring the dereliction of his Father, acknowledged that as his Victim he was to be forſaken, though as his Son he remained
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115672:156"/>inſeparable; nor that it was juſt for God to go out of his reſt to deliver him from his ſorrows, or to avenge him of his enemies. <hi>Tu autem in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto habitas laus Iſrael.</hi> But becauſe we cannot ſpeak much of a Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Greatneſs amazeth us, and the luſtre whereof dazzles us, we paſs to the Fulneſs of God, which is the Third Motive of our duty of Sacrifice.
<note place="margin">Sadai appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Deus ab He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braeis, hoc eſt ſibi ſufficiens.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>God is ſo Immenſe, that, by a glorious Impotency he can do nothing which is not uſeleſs in reſpect of Himſelf: Whatever he produceth out of his Eſſence, is unworthy of his employment: Inaſmuch as he findes his happineſs in himſelf, he ſtands not in need of our Magnificats; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his felicity ſupplies him with inexhauſtible riches, he hath no need of our Preſents: he poſſeſſeth all things in a tranſcendent eminency; and they are much nobler in him then in themſelves.

Thence it comes to paſs that we deliver up Victims to the knife, and conſume them in the fire, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh aloud that we pretend not to enrich him that poſſeſſeth all things, and who would not be God, did he ſtand in need of our Oblations. <hi>Dixi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino, Deus meus es tu, quoniam bonorum meorum non eges.</hi> Therefore in the very ſtate of Innocence they poured out the Liquors that were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they burnt the Fruits that were preſented; and ſtriving to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, proclaimed openly that they were no way profitable to him.</p>
                  <p>But ſince ſin hath robbed us of original righteouſneſs, we were obliged to joyn offended Juſtice to theſe three Perfections, and to offer Sacrifice to him, to pacifie his Fury.

This ſhameful neceſſity diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to him onely the Goodneſs of God, who was content that Beaſts ſhould be offered up in ſtead of Men: but it upbraided him with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and made him wofully reſent, that being able to offend his Creator, he could by no means make him ſatisfaction. Having imprinted this truth in his minde, and for many Generations reading him this leſſon, that he that pretended to equal the Almighty, was in a worſe condition then the Beaſts: in proceſs of time, it was demonſtrated to him that his crime was too great to be expiated by the blood of Goats or Lambs, and that his exceſs required a Sacrifice whoſe merit was Infinite.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, that a Sacrifice might be acceptable to God, it muſt have thoſe qualities which are found neither in Angels, nor Men, nor Beaſts. For it muſt be Innocent, and no way obnoxious to that evil whereof it is to be the remedy: It muſt be Reaſonable, to treat with God, and to ſpeak in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of them whoſe place he appears in: It muſt be mortal, that it may undergo the puniſhment ſin hath deſerved, and thereby ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice: But above all, its merit muſt of neceſſity be Infinite, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to the malice of ſin, the honour of God may have full repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the debt of man an entire compleat acquittance.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:115672:157"/>Merit: The Beaſt, more happie in ſome ſort then Man, was Mortal and Innocent; but having not the uſe of Reaſon, his death was unprofitable, nor could his ſacrifice reconcile us to God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore did the Eternal Word contrive to be Incarnate, that, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Divine Nature with the Humane in his Perſon, there might come forth a Divine Compoſitum, which, being God and Man both together, might poſſeſs all the qualities requiſite to accompliſh the work of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. He was Mortal, becauſe he was Man, and had aſſumed our Nature, with its imperfections, the appurtenances of ſin: He was Innocent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſubſiſted in the perſon of the Word, which managed his Will without conſtraining it, and by a happie neceſſity made him abſolutely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable: He was Reaſonable, inaſmuch as having taken our imperfections, he withal took our advantages; and, by a priviledge due to his Greatneſs, the uſe of Reaſon was indulged him with life, that from the firſt moment of his conception he might honour his Father, and ſatisfie for ſinners: His Merit was, as his Perſon, Infinite; and the actions that were performed by this God-Man were Meritorious, becauſe Humane; and on the other fide, Infinite, becauſe Divine. Thus the Word Incarnate became the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of God and Men; and entering into our duties, paid what we ſtood bound for to the Juſtice of his Father: he ſuffered what our ſins deſerved, and delivered us from thoſe puniſhments our ſentence condemned us to.</p>
                  <p>But being the Subſtance of all the Shadows of the Old Teſtament, and by his acquitting us being obliged to fulfil all the Figures thereof, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up himſelf to the Eternal Father by a double Sacrifice, that one ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conding the other, the Chriſtians might render as much honour to God as the Jews. For the Synagogue had four kindes of Sacrifices: The Firſt was the Holocauſt, which reſpected the glory of God, wherein the Victim was wholly conſumed by the fire: The Second was an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſin, where the Oblation being parted between God and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, one part was burnt in the fire, and the other remained to the Prieſt for his nouriſhment: The Third and Fourth were called Peace-offerings, with this diſtinction, that the one was made to obtain ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, or to give him thanks for what was already received; the other, to acquit the offerer of his promiſes, and to accompliſh thoſe vows he ſtood engaged to God for. In theſe two laſt Sacrifices, the Victim was divided into Three parts: The Firſt was conſecrated to God, the Second deſigned to the Prieſt, and the Third left to the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>Therefore hath the Son of God joyned the Sacrifice of the Croſs with that of the Altar, to accompliſh all thoſe of the Old Law: Upon the Croſs he offered up himſelf an Holocauſt to his Father; where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed by death, he roſe from the Grave, to be conſummated in Glory, and to be received into the boſom of his Father, from whence he came forth by the Myſtery of the Incarnation. But becauſe in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation where the Sacrifice is wholly reduced into God, men have no part,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115672:157"/>he was pleaſed to inſtitute another in his Church, where giving himſelf wholly to his Father,

But for the better underſtanding of a truth which is one of the principal Articles of our Faith, and to reſolve the difficulties Hereſie oppoſeth againſt theſe two ſacrifices; we muſt know, that both of them make up but one; and that one without the other would be utterly unprofitable: For the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture teacheth us, that to the perfection of a ſacrifice,

                     </note> as a thing dedicated to God, and which ought to periſh for his glory. The ſecond part of the ſacrifice was the oblation of the Victime, where according to the form preſcribed in the Law, or taught by Tradition, it was actually offered to God, and began to appertain to him by a new right, greater then that of ſanctification. The third was the death or killing of the Victime, which though the moſt ſenſible part of the ſacrifice, was not yet the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall; becauſe it was performed by the Levites, and not by the Prieſts; in the Court of the Temple, and not in the place next the Sanctuary: The fourth was the conſummation of the ſacrifice which was devoured by the flame; that the ſmoak aſcending up into Heaven, God might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the oblation, as the Scripture teſtifieth in thoſe words, <hi>Odoratus eſt Dominus ſacrificium;</hi> and that which ſeems to have given ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the falſe opinion of the Heathen, who imagined that God was nouriſhed with the fume of the offerings. The fifth was the communion of the Victime, which as we have already obſerved, was ſometimes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to God, ſometimes was divided between God, the Prieſt and the people: But inaſmuch as theſe ſacrifices were but the types and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of that which Jeſus Chriſt was to offer to his Father, he did not partake of it but in a figure by means of fire, which in the belief of the world was accounted the nobleſt repreſentatation of the Divinity, <hi>Deus
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115672:158"/>noſter Ignis conſumens eſt;</hi> as for the people and the Prieſt, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated really, and received the ſacrifice into their mouth to diſgeſt it in their ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>If Jeſus Chriſt be the accompliſhment of the Law, his Sacrifice muſt neceſſarily comprehend all theſe parts; and we muſt find on the Altar, what we do not find on the Croſſe. His ſanctification is fully evident; for beſides that he is the firſt-born, and in that conſideration is holy; we know that he is the work of the Holy Ghoſt; that his Father is God; that his Mother is a Virgin, and that his Conception is altogether Immaculate: But his Divine Perſon is his principal ſanctification; and if other ſacrifices be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by ſome tranſient words, this is conſecrated by the Eternal and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word: The ſame Unction that made him Prieſt, made him the Victime, and dedicated him by a double title to the ſervice of the Altar. His obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion began in the womb of the Bleſſed Virgin; continued in the Temple, and during his life, and was at laſt finiſhed upon the Croſſe: In the womb of his mother he offered himſelf in ſpirit, according to the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> and explaining his mind in the words of the Prophet, he proteſts that he took a body only to be immolated to his Father: In the Temple he was preſented by the hands of the Virgin, and received by <hi>Simeon,</hi> who penetrating the deſign of Jeſus Chriſt and his mother, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers their intentions, and inſtructs her in the myſtery of the Croſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this oblation was the prologue. During his life he continued to offer up himſelf to his Father as an innocent Victime, till upon the Croſſe he acquitted himſelf of his promiſes, and ſatisfied his obligations; <hi>Obtulit ſe immaculatum Deo per Spiritum Sanctum.</hi> His death appeared upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> where making uſe of the cruelty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of the treaſon of <hi>Judas,</hi> and of the rage of the Executioners, he was offered up for our ſalvation: But becauſe it is not the principal part of the ſacrifice which is not compleat, if the Victime be not conſummated, it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that the Reſurrection ſhould finiſh what Death began. Indeed the Reſurrection of the Son of God is his conſummation; 'tis in this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that Glory ſwallowed up what Death had left; that he parts with whatever remained of periſhable; that he enters into that Majeſty which is due to his Birth; that he is reduced to God, and received into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of his Father, his lawful and natural habitation. This is the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> attributes the perfection of our ſalvation, becauſe it is the Crown of the Sacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt; Therefore diſcourſing of what we owe his Death and his Glory, he ſaith, <hi>Mortuus eſt propter pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata noſtra, &amp; reſurrexit propter juſtificationem noſtram:</hi> where he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the principal effect of our ſalvation, not to the Paſſion, but to the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. There it is in a word, that Jeſus is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that his work is accompliſhed, where he is happily conſummated; where the Divine Eſſence having the ſame operation in him, that the fire had in the ſacrifice, he is deſpoiled of our infirmities, and inveſted with all the glories of his Father.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:115672:158"/>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as the life of a Chriſtian is a ſacrifice which honours that of the Word Incarnate, it is not terminated ſo much by Death as by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; nor will the Faithful be truly conſummated, till he ſhall be transformed into God by the ſplendours of Glory. Therefore doth Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Comment upon that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Introibo in domum tuam in Holocauſtis,</hi> deliver theſe excellent words which ſerve greatly to illuſtrate this truth: The Holocauſt is a Sacrifice, wherein the Victime is wholly devoured by the fire; and the Church, in the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe hath one day to be admitted into Heaven, uſeth the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and perſwades her ſelf that the fire of glory will conſume her, to the end that nothing of her ſelf remaining in her, ſhe may be wholly her Beloveds: This deſire will not be accompliſht till the general Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when our mortal ſhall be cloathed with Immortality, and life ſhall triumph over death; the Divine fire will produce this effect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming all our periſhable being will make of us an Holocauſt: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing mortall ſhall remain in our fleſh; nothing culpable in our ſoul; both of them ſhall be conſummated by life, that paſſing into a new being we may become the Holocauſts of the Lord. That which ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall all Chriſtians at the day of the generall Reſurrection, did happen to Jeſus Chriſt at the day of his glorious Reſurrection; Death was ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in Life, Glory conſumed infirmity, and leaving the likeneſs of ſin, he entred into the Majeſty of God his Father.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this ſacrifice would be impetfect, if the Communion did not ſucceed the Conſummation; The love &amp; power of Jeſus Chriſt invented a means, whereby without departing from God, he might communicate himſelf to the Faithful, and make them partakers of his body and bloud. This is done upon our Altars, where offering up himſelf daily, he fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ſacrifice of the Croſs; and by a myſtery worthy of his charity, he communicates not only the merits of his death, but the very victime that was immolated upon Mount <hi>Calvary.</hi> It bears the name of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, not only becauſe it finiſheth that of the Croſs, which preciſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing but the killing of the ſacrifice, but for that it exhibits all the marks of a true ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>For beſides that it is the verity of the ſacrifice of <hi>Melchiſedeh,</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the High Prieſt, who hath commanded his Miniſters to doe it in remembrance of him: We may ſay, without any offence to piety, that it hath more ſhew of a ſacrifice, then that of the Croſs, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with Prayer, ſucceeds the eating of the Paſchal Lamb as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſhadow; contains an innocent victime; is inſtituted by words dedicated to ſacrifices; and examining it ſeriouſly, we ſhall find the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the victime, becauſe there it is offered by the hands of the Prieſt; His myſtical death, becauſe immolated not by the knife, but by the Word of God; its perfect conſummation, becauſe in a glorious condition which reſcues it from all humane miſeries; and its communion, becauſe taken

                  <p>For the right underſtanding of this difference we muſt know, that the ſacrifice of the Croſs is a ſacrifice of Redemption;

Inaſmuch as all thoſe things are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe performed then by the death of Chriſt, which cannot be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a miracle; and the Glory whereinto he is entred, ſuffers him not to die a ſecond time: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that he redeemed the world by that one only ſacrifice; The Prieſts of the Old Teſtament were bound to reiterate their ſacrifices, becauſe the merit of the victime was limited;
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115672:159"/>and, to ſpeak properly, were neither acceptable to God, nor meritorious for men, but becauſe they were the Figures of Jeſus Chriſt: But inaſmuch as the Sacrifice he offered to his Father upon the Croſs is of infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he need not repeat it; and having ſufficiently expiated all the ſins of the world, it had been uſeleſs to pacifie God who was no longer offended, and to ſatisfie for thoſe faults which were already pardoned.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs that the Sacraments which exhibit the death of the Son of God, and are applicatory to us of their merit, imprint a Character upon us, and are never performed twice. Baptiſm is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred but once, not onely becauſe it is the Chriſtians birth, which cannot be done over again, but alſo becauſe it is the Figure of the death of Chriſt, which, according to the language of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <hi>Sicut ſemel Chriſtus mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Cruce, ita ſemel Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus moritur in Baptiſmo.</hi> Aug.</note> cannot be readminiſtred without offence. Therefore is it that the ſame Apoſtle, condemning thoſe that gave themſelves over to ſin, in hope to make an atonement by a ſecond Baptiſm, ſaid to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that they crucified again the Son of God, and that, contrary to his intention, and that of his Church, they would make him die twice in their perſon, who died but once in his own; <hi>Rur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum crucifigentes ſibimet ipſis Filium Dei, &amp; oſtentui habentes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as the Sacrifice of the Altar is a Sacrifice of Religion, it muſt of neceſſity be repeated; and for the continual honouring of the Eternal Father, muſt continually be immolated in our Temples. Therefore is it that the Synagogue, which was the Figure of the Church, had ſome Sacrifices which were offered but once every yeer; nor had been offered but once at all, had they had the merit and value of that of the Croſs: But there were others offered every day, which the Scripture for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon calls <hi>Juge Sacrificium.</hi> The Church, which hath not leſs piety then the Synagogue, imitates and outgoes it in this point, becauſe it offers a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice, and never changeth the Victim. For 'tis always the ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhe produceth and immolateth; that ſatisfying her love, ſhe may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an honour to God which ends not but with the world. Her Beloved, who hath inſpired her with this deſire, hath given her the means to put it in execution; ſhe acts by the vertue received from him; ſhe repeats his words, to repeat his miracles; ſhe produceth upon the Altars him that produced her upon the Croſs; ſhe becomes the mother of him whoſe daughter ſhe is; and, by a happie exchange, conceives in her chaſte womb him that heretofore conceived her in his wounds. Thus this Sacrifice of Love is repeated every day; and the Victim being inceſſantly produced by the Prieſt, the Eternal Father is continually honoured.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond difference is, that the Sacrifice of the Croſs is General, and that of the Altar Particular. Upon the Croſs the Son of God was offered up for the ſalvation of all men; his love is extended over all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth; he excludes no Condition from this univerſal benefit; he looks upon the Gentiles together with the Jews, he mingles the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Innocent; and making no diſtinction of perſons, dies as well
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115672:160"/>for Slaves as for thoſe that are Free,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ne exiſtimes pro illa tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo gente hanc hoſtiam offerri: propterea extra muros &amp; extra civitatem occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur, ut intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas quoniam communis eſt hoſtia pro hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano genere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata.</hi> Aug.</note> and for the Poor as well as for the Rich. Therefore neither was this Sacrifice offered in the Temple, nor in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that all people might know this favour was not particular; and the moſt deſperately-wicked might pretend to it, ſince the firſt that felt the effect thereof were Theeves and Murtherers: But the Sacrifice of the Altar is particular; being inſtituted in the Church, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates onely to the Faithful; its Merit, though infinite, reacheth not to ſtrangers; excommunicated perſons are baniſhed from it, neither are the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> admitted: The wedding-garment is requiſite for thoſe that are received; and being a Feaſt as well as a Sacrifice, they muſt be the Friends of the Bridegroom that are partakers of it.</p>
                  <p>But the third and moſt notable difference is, that upon the Croſs the Sacrifice was blended with Sacriledge; whereas upon the Altar it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether pure, attended with nothing that makes it not acceptable to God. It is one of the Miracles of Providence, to make wicked inſtruments ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to its deſignes, and to employ their very malice to the execution of its will and intendments. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ows his Greatneſs to the Hatred of his Brethren; and their ill diſpoſition, well husbanded by the conduct of heaven, made him ſit upon the Throne of <hi>Egypt.</hi> That prodigie of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, whoſe example comforts all that are miſerable, is glorious by his very detriment; and had not the devil been permitted to afflict him, he would not be the wonder and aſtoniſhment of all the Righteous. The Martyrs were not admired by Chriſtians but becauſe they were perſecuted by Tyrants; and had they not given proofs of their courage in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, they never had triumphed with Jeſus Chriſt in Glory. But that which moſt aſtoniſheth me, is, that the very Paſſion of the Son of God was not effected but by the malice of men and devils; this Sacrifice is accompanied with a Sacriledge; and the holieſt action of the world is ſhrowded under the appearance of a murder. In reſpect of the Son of God, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſacred then his death: 'tis the moſt illuſtrious teſtimony of his Obedience, the laſt office of his Piety, the greateſt expreſſion of his Love, and the moſt memorable action of his Life: There is no Creature that is not beholding to him for it: Men owe him their Salvation, the Angels their Crowns, the Elements their Deliverance, the Earth her Purity, and Heaven its Ornament and Glory.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider this Death in reſpect of the Jews, we want words to expreſs the horrour thereof with: It was the moſt unjuſt Sentence that ever was pronounced, the moſt ſhameful ignominious puniſhment that an Innocent ever ſuffered, the moſt execrable attempt that ever was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Rebellious Subjects; in a word, the moſt abominable Parricide that ever was committed by unnatural Children. Comparing the motive of the Jews with that of Jeſus Chriſt, we cannot ſay whether God was more honoured or more offended upon Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> nor whether Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conceived more horrour or compaſſion at the Tragedie. The Eternal
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115672:160"/>Father was abundantly ſatisfied,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibi Deus per malos quidem, ſed tamen ipſe bonus; per inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos, ſed juſtus &amp; juſte: ita in eos vindicavit, ut perimerentur multa hominum millia, &amp; ipſa civitas everte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi> Aug. in Pſal. 73.</note> becauſe in conſideration thereof he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat his injuries and our ſins, and conſented that his enemies ſhould become his heirs: But on the other ſide, he was mightily offended, becauſe he diſcharged his wrath upon <hi>Judea,</hi> armed the Romanes againſt the Jews, ſackt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and his Temple; and, his juſt indignation not ſatisfied with ſo many miſeries, perſecutes to this day that vagabond and criminal Nation.</p>
                  <p>Nature imitates the minde of her Author; all her parts teſtified their Anger and their Pity: The Earth trembled, to ſwallow up the executioners in her fearful abyſſes; the Rocks clave aſunder with grief; the Stars ſunk into the Firmament, that they might not be the witneſſes of this Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; the Sun was eclipſed, that it might not enlighten ſuch prodigious wickedneſs; and whole Nature being not able to deſtroy them, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die with her God that died for her. Thus Sacriledge was mixed with the Sacrifice of the Croſs; the Father was Oftended even whilſt he was Satisfied; and the whole world was ſcandalized by the crime of the Jews, at the ſame time when it was purified by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But Sanctity is altogether ſpotleſs upon our Altars; there appears not that Medley which makes a confuſed mixture of Love and Hatred in our hearts; and the Sacrifice that is offered is no longer a Sacriledge to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted: It is not Cruelty that makes Jeſus Chriſt die, but Piety: 'Tis no longer a Crime, but an act of Religion to immolate him; neither is he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the hands of Executioners, but of Prieſts. The Father receives this Sacrifice with Pleaſure, without Indignation; the Son preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Affection free from Sorrow; Nature beholds it with Reſpect and no Horrour; and Men partake of it Profitably and without Sin.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt difference is, that the Sacrifice of the Croſs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits all, and applies nothing; and contrarily, that of the Altar merits no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and applies all. For the comprehending of this Truth, we muſt know, that General Cauſes are the ſources of all things: nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced here belowe, that flows not from their fecundity: the very operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Particular Cauſes is an emanation of their vertue. Did the Sun ceaſe to ſhine, all things of the world would not onely ceaſe to act, but alſo to ſubſiſt: this goodly Star maintains them with its aſpects; and though he be not their Creator, he is in ſome ſort their Preſerver: But though he equally ſhed heat and light over all Creatures, yet muſt we confeſs ſome receive his influences more favourably, and apply them more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: With the Clouds he forms thoſe Meteors which pleaſantly raviſh the eyes of the beholders; with dew he enamels the Flowers which ſerve for an ornament to our Gardens; with the Earth he produceth Gold and Iron, which Avarice and Cruelty employed to a hundred different uſes: But did not theſe Cauſes that apply his power, weaken his vertue; and were there a Sun here belowe to receive his influences without confining them,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115672:161"/>all the world are of opinion he would produce far nobler effects,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Virtus Cauſae generalis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitur à cauſa particulari ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum ſuam agendi capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi> D. Tho.</note> and that in ſtead of Roſes and Lilies we ſhould ſee nothing but Stars in our Walks and Gardens: But becauſe he cannot act alone, and the Cauſes that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply him debilitate his power, we behold nothing here belowe anſwerable either to his excellency or beauty.</p>
                  <p>What we ſee in Nature, we believe in Grace: General Cauſes produce all, but apply nothing; Particular Cauſes produce nothing, but apply all. The death of Jeſus Chriſt is the Spring-head of all Merit: the Faithful can hope for nothing which is not acquired by that Sacrifice: Heaven is not ſo much the recompence of their Vertue, as of its Value: and if the quality of Members, which ties them to Jeſus Chriſt as to their Head, did not give them part in his merits, they could not pretend to the inheritance of heaven. In the mean time, ſo powerful a Cauſe produceth nothing, if not applied: this fruitful Fountain ſends forth no ſtreams, if there be no Chanels diſpoſed to receive them:
<note place="margin">Mors Chriſti Fons omnium bonorum, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta vero Rivuli.</note> and this Star, which darts forth ſo much heat and light, makes neither flowers nor fruit grow up in the Church, if there be not ſome ſecondary cauſe which conveys its vertue to us. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Son of God inſtituted Sacraments in his Church, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily apply whatever he hath liberally merited for us upon the Croſs: They are ſo many Pipes iſſuing his blood into our hearts, ſo many Suns carrying their influences into our ſouls: but they have this unhappineſs in applying his merits, they weaken them; and not being capable of receiving all his vertue, neither have they the power of communicating it to us. Every Sacrament operates in us according to its particular condition. Baptiſm gives us our new birth;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sacramenta no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae legis repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentant paſſione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſti, à qua fluxerunt, ſicut effectus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentant cauſam.</hi> Hugo à San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto Victor.</note> Confirmation ſtrengthens us; Repentance raiſeth us; Ordination deſignes us to the ſervice of the Altar; and, being ſecond cauſes, they limit the vertue of this univerſal cauſe which they apply unto us. But the Sacrifice of the Altar, more happie and more powerful then the reſt, applies the merits of the Croſs without any limitation: It procures us all kinde of Graces, hath the power to produce and raiſe us, gives us life and ſtrength, unites us to God, and takes us off from the world, weakens concupiſcence and ſin; and the Son of God finding himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by himſelf, there are no wonderful effects which he cannot give a product to: There he merits nothing, becauſe he is at the end of his Courſe, in the place of his Reſt, and in the time of his Recompence; But he applies all, becauſe, being equal to himſelf, he hath gained nothing by the Sacrifice of the Croſs, which he cannot communicate by the Sacrifice of the Altar: Nothing can hinder his divine operations, but our Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or our Malice: for as he acts with Free cauſes without conſtraining them, we muſt lend him our Will for our Sanctification; that making him Maſter of our hearts, we may in ſome ſort aſſiſt him to raign abſolutely in his State, and prepare our ſelves worthily to receive at the Altar thoſe Graces he hath merited for us upon the Croſs.</p>

Indeed he is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son of the Church; he produced her upon the Croſs, and is produced by her upon the Altar: He is the Son and the Servant of his Father; he aſſociates two qualities which appear incompatible in men; and tempering reſpect with love, teacheth us, that Gods being his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hinders him not from being his Soveraign: He is our Advocate and our Judge; having pleaded our cauſe, he pronounceth our ſentence; and I know not whether it be a ground of fear or of confidence, in that we are aſſured that he that is entred into our obligations, is admitted alſo into the rights of his Father; and that one day he will puniſh thoſe for whom he hath ſatisfied upon the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>But if there be any qualities whoſe alliance raviſheth us in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt confeſs 'tis that of Prieſt and Sacrifice: Theſe two are ſo different among men, that nothing but a ſupream power, or an extream love, could unite them together. When the Synagogue would repreſent us with the Sacrifice of the Son of God in that of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> it was obliged to ſeparate the Prieſt from the Victime, and to arm the hands of the Father to immolate his only Son: In the mean time Jeſus Chriſt unites them in his perſon; and in this adorable Sacrifice which he offers to his Father, whether on the Croſs or on the Altar, he is both the Prieſt that conſecrateth, and the Victime that is immolated. Inaſmuch as Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is our God and our Temple, he is alſo our Sacrifice and our Prieſt: He is the Prieſt that reconciles us; he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice whereby we are reconciled; and the ſame Doctor admiring the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties of the ſacrifice of the Croſs, expreſſeth his wonder by theſe words: The Altar of the Sacrifice is new, becauſe the Immolation is new and admirable; For he that is the Sacrifice is the Prieſt; the Sacrifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fleſh; the Prieſt, according to the Spirit; and both, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115672:162"/>to his Humanity: He that offereth, and he that is offered, is one and the ſame perſon, and theſe qualities which have ſo little analogy are found united in the ſacrifice of the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as the Chriſtian is the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, and this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous title obligeth him to tranſcribe his original, he ought to ſacrifice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as he did, and to be both the Prieſt and the Oblation together. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if we deſcend into the Myſteries of our Religion, and conſider with the eye of Faith what we are not able to diſcover with the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, we ſhall find that we are immolated upon the Altar with the Son of God, and that after his example, we are both the ſacrificers and the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: For Jeſus Chriſt is not offered all alone in our Temples; he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molated by the hands of the Prieſts; and at the ſame time that he offers his natural body to his Father, he offers alſo his myſtical body; ſo that offering himſelf to his Father by his Church, and offering his Church to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with himſelf, he teacheth all the Faithful to joyn the quality of Prieſts with that of Victimes.</p>
                  <p>This is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> informs us of in his Book <hi>De Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Dei;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

'Tis particularly ſaith he, in unity that the ſacrifice of Chriſtians conſiſts, where being many in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber we make up but one body with Jeſus Chriſt; this is it that the Church daily does in this Sacrament, which is ſo well known to the Faithfull, wherein is demonſtrated that in the Oblation ſhe offers, ſhe her ſelf is offered, that after the example of her Beloved, ſhe may be in the ſame ſacrifice Prieſteſs and Victime. From this paſſage may eaſily be inferred, that the Faithful are offered with Chriſt upon the Altar; that the Hoſt that contains him is large enough to contain all his members; and that his myſticall body being immolated with his natural body, he obligeth all Chriſtians to aſſociate as he doth, the quality of Victime with that of a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>But if leaving the Altar, we conſider the Faithful in the courſe of their life, we ſhall ſee there is none but ought to ſacrifice himſelf, and who either in his body or in his ſoul may not find Victimes to offer to God. There is no more need of providing Buls or Goats with the Jews to lay upon our Altars: The time of the Moſaical Law is paſt; truths have ſucceeded figures; and if we rightly underſtand the ſecret of our myſteries,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Noli extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus thura com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parare, ſed dic, In me ſunt Deus vota tua; noli extrinſecus pecus quod mactes inquirere; habes in te quod occidas.</hi> Aug. in Pſal. 51.</note> it becomes us to offer thoſe things theſe Animals repreſent. We have whereof to ſacrifice within our ſelves; there is not any paſſion in our ſoul nor part in our body, whereof we may not make an innocent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:115672:162"/>Victime. Indeed Chriſtian Religion converting the ſinner into a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, obligeth him to immolate to God all that he is: He is deficient in the lawfulleſt of his duties, if his whole life be not a ſacrifice; and being compounded of ſoul and body, he ought to ſacrifice both, that he may have the honour to be a perfect Holocauſt.</p>
                  <p>The vertues are auxiliaries which facilitate theſe means, and it ſeems theſe glorious habits are given us for no other end then to teach us to ſacrifice to God all the faculties of our ſoul. Inaſmuch as the will is the nobleſt, and this Soveraign being once perfectly gained over to God, gives him an abſolute dominion over all the reſt; there are ſome vertues which have no other employment but to be made victimes. Sorrow which diſcovers to man the exceſs of his crime, labours to convert him; it brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his heart by the violence of a holy contrition; and if it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not draw bloud from this ſacrifice, it draws tears, which are more acceptable to God then the bloud of beaſts. This made <hi>David</hi> ſay, that the ſpirit broken and afflicted, was a true ſacrifice; and that he who ſometimes refuſeth Goats and Lambs, never deſpiſeth a heart that Repentance and Humility offers up unto him; <hi>Sacrificium Deo ſpiritus contribulatus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obedience comes in to the ſuccour of grief; this beats down the pride of the will, maſters that imperious faculty; and changing her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph into a ſacrifice, obligeth her to die to her own inclinations, that ſhe may live to thoſe of the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt: But love happily finiſheth this deſign; he burns the victime with his flames to render it an Holocauſt; and finding the means to put to death an immortall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, teacheth us, that a pure ſpirit may offer ſacrifices to God: For there is no lover but knows that love imitates death, that he commits inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent murders; and by ſtratagems which himſelf is only privy to, makes ſin die in us that Grace may live.</p>
                  <p>If the will become a Victim by means of Charity, the underſtanding is offered up to God by the intervening of faith; This vertue ſubjects it to her Empire, perſwades truths ſhe explicates not; ſhe obligeth a man to ſuſpend his judgement, to renounce his reaſon, and to give his ſenſes the lye; ſhe engageth him to offer as many ſacrifices as ſhe propounds my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; and by a power which would ſeem tyrannical were it not legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, forbids him the uſe of reaſoning in matters of religion.</p>
                  <p>The memory after the example of the underſtanding, is immolated to God by remembrance and forgetfulneſs; Theſe two different ways make two contrary ſacrifices; This faculty calls to mind the benefits received from its Creator, and forgets the injuries received from Enemies: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two exerciſes it is equally divided, and whatever outrage ſin hath committed in our ſoul, ſhe finds that the art of oblivion is harder then that of retaining or learning. 'Tis upon the firſt that the love of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is founded, which ſeems the moſt troubleſome ſacrifice of Ghriſtian
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:115672:163"/>Religion; and upon the other, acknowledgment or the action of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which is the juſteſt duty of the creature towards his Creator.</p>
                  <p>Though the body be the leaſt moity of man, yet is it not deſtitute of Victims which it furniſheth him with to appeaſe God; and according to the different vertues that inform it, offers ſacrifices which are little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to thoſe of the minde. Repentance afflicts it a hundred ſeverall ways; and this vertue no leſs auſtere then witty, invents every day new means to tame its rebellion, and of a diſobedient ſlave to make a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſacrifice: Sometimes ſhe puniſhes his boldneſs by faſting; ſometimes abates his ſtrength by watchings; ſometimes lets him bloud by diſciplines; ſometimes tames his pride with aſhes; Finally, by theſe divers artifices ſhe lets us ſee, that a penitent is nothing but a man armed againſt himſelf, who offers a ſacrifice of Juſtice, when he is more offended at his own ſins then thoſe of his neighbour: Repentance cals in Continence many times to her aid; for when this rebel reſiſts grief, ſhe forbids him the uſe of the moſt lawful pleaſures; and depriving him of whatever he loves, makes a victim of him, which ſuffers the more, the ſlower his ſorrow is, and his ſacrifice more ſharp and irkſome.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the eye and the mouth are the moſt guilty parts of man, repentance obligeth the firſt to bewail his ſins, changeth his fountain of flames into flouds of tears, compels this complice of impurity to become the Miniſter of ſorrow, forceth this faithful Interpreter of the heart to betray it no more with his glances, and to be cloſed to all objects which might trouble his reſt or pervert his good deſigns, ſhe deals more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly with the mouth; for ſeeing this is guilty of two contrary evils, and his ſilence is ſometimes as criminal as his words, this part is condemned to two different puniſhments, ſometimes being obliged to keep ſilence, ſometims to ſpeak: of his ſilence and of his diſcourſe is compoſed one and the ſame ſacrifice; The mouth is obliged to open in chanting forth the praiſes of its Creator; and having diſcharged this part of duty when the words are no longer anſwerable to the greatneſs of the ſubject, it hath recourſe to ſilence, and by wonder and aſtoniſhment makes amends for thoſe faults committed by too much liberty. This double ſacrifice hath its value and its price; and the Scripture which tels us that God is pleaſed with praiſes, acquaints us alſo that ſilence, when ariſing from a great reſpect, is not unacceptable to him. By the firſt, we profeſs that he is the Authour of all perfections, that ours are derived from him; and becauſe ſpeech is an advantage we hold from his goodneſs, it ought to be conſecrated to his honour: By the ſecond, we tacitly confeſs, that as his Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence cannot be known, neither can it be expreſſed; and that of all the ways we have to magnifie him by, ſilence is moſt agreeable to his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and our humility.</p>
                  <p>After that man hath immolated his body and his ſoul, he is obliged to tender his goods, and to offer him a ſacrifice of all that he poſſeſſeth: Alms
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115672:163"/>and Poverty are his aſſiſtants in ſo pious a deſign; and theſe two vertues by different mediums arrive at the ſame end; for Alms parts goods with God, and looking upon Jeſus Chriſt in the perſon of the poor, reſtores that to his indigence which he received of his bounty: 'Tis true in this point his meaning is much different from thoſe that addreſs themſelves by way of ſacrifice; for they when they offer a victim ſlay him at the Altar, to teſtifie that their preſents are uſeleſs to God, becauſe being the ſource of all good, nothing can be given him which he poſſeſſeth not in himſelf. But he that doth Alms hath this ſatisfaction,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Noli contemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Chriſtum in coelo ſedentem, in terra egente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; veniet cum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributione, &amp; vita aeterna, &amp; igne aeterno.</hi> Aug.</note> that his ſacrifice is not unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe though he be happy in his perſon, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent in his members. Poverty out-bids Alms, deſpoils a man of all, is of the nature of the Holocauſt, where he that ſacrificeth reſerving nothing to himſelf, gives all wholly to God: This forſakes not goods only, but the very deſires alſo, renounceth all pretenſions to the Earth, and not content to offer God what is in poſſeſſion, beſtows upon him whatever may be hoped for; ſo that this ſacrifice being as large as Hope, we may ſay, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all that this paſſion, which is boundleſs, promiſeth the Ambitious or the Covetous.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Chriſtian acquits himſelf of the promiſe he made in Baptiſm, and conſecrating his ſoul by Charity, his body by Repentance, and his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by Alms or Poverty, ſatisfies both his obligations and his promiſes:

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough men are dignified by Qualities, being the marks either of their Birth or Deſert; yet muſt we confeſs that they adde nothing to their Perſons, nor imprint any Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon their Soul or Body: They are fair illuſions which pleaſingly deceive us, Dreams that amuſe men awake, Charms that inchant thoſe that are in love with them. They owe their Luſtre to our Blindneſs, their Grandeur to our Ignorance: For the higheſt dignities which ſo much diſquiet the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, are but the Errours of their Underſtanding, and the Idols of their Imagination: ſhould we pare away from Great Perſonages the attendance of their followers, the pomp of their habits, and the magnificence of their houſes,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Magna Fortuna magna Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Senec.</note> we ſhould finde their Charges meer Chimera's; and that which we call Fortune, nothing but a Falſe Greatneſs, or a Real Slavery.</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as the Qualities of a Chriſtian are not the works of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but ſuch as imprint Characters, or produce effects in their ſouls, they are as ſolid as glorious; they raiſe men up to heaven, make them heirs of the Eternal Father, and brethren of his onely Son: Their greatneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon the opinion of people; though they are unknown, they are notwithſtanding honourable: ſometimes Contempt augments their reputation; and the leſs ſplendor they bear amongſt men, the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect they finde with God. Therefore I ſhould betray the honour of the Chriſtian, if, having ſpoken of his Vertues, I ſhould not ſpeak of his Qualities; and, having deſcribed his Labours and his Sacrifices, I ſhould ſay nothing of his Rewards and Recompences. True it is, that, as the parts of this work are mutually interwoven, and the remoteſt have ſecret links that unite them all together; in ſpeaking of the Chriſtians Birth I have handled his Nobleſt Qualities, and have made it appear, that he was
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115672:164"/>the Brother and the Member of Jeſus Chriſt, that he was the adopted Son of the Eternal Father, and the living Temple of the holy Ghoſt. In making the Elogie of his Vertues, I ſhewed that Faith made him a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Charity a Lover, Auſterity of life a Penitent; ſo that having already ſpoken of theſe advantages, there remains onely to ſupply what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, to compleat his Portraicture, which I cannot better begin, then in demonſtrating in this Diſcourſe that the Chriſtian is the Image of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For the happier explaining of this Verity, we muſt know, that the Word is the Image of his Father, the Character of his Subſtance,

                        <hi>Qui videt me, videt &amp; Patre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Joan. 14.</note> the Expreſs of his Greatneſs: He gives himſelf this Title in the Goſpel, and teacheth his Diſciples, that, in ſeeing Him, they ſee his Father in his perſon. Our Divines abound with Reaſons of this Aſſertion, to prove that this Elogie is not unworthy of the Eternal Word, and that his being the lively Image of his Father, no way hinders his being equal with him. But, not to trouble my ſelf in the proof of a Truth Faith obligeth us to believe, it is enough, with the great S. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> to let you ſee, that this Divine Image hath none of thoſe defects which are inſeparably incident to thoſe of our Carvers and Painters: for,
<note place="margin">Exiſtimavit Philo Judaeus prohibitas eſſe à Deo picturas, quia ſunt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacia.</note> the moſt exact Pieces that come from their hands are falſe, becauſe they are not that which they repreſent; nor can all the induſtry of Art make them other then agreeable Illuſions: Though they are Lyers, yet are they mute; painting cannot make them ſpeak; and the higheſt commendation can be given them, is, to ſay that nothing but Speech is wanting to them: Laſtly, they are dead: Art, leſs powerful then Nature, cannot inanimate them; what ever dexterity it uſeth, it cannot enliven them: they are children that expire in their very birth; and, could they ſpeak, would complain of the rigour of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who, in ſtead of making them Men, have made them onely Idols. Now this Image that ſo lively repreſents the Eternal Father, hath none of theſe imperfections: It is very far from a Lye, becauſe it is ſo conformable to its Original, that 'tis as well his Truth as his Copie: It is not dumb, becauſe it is the Interpreter of the Father, his Eternal Panegyrick, his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Word, all whoſe works are ſo many expreſſions chanting forth the praiſes of their Authour: It is not dead, becauſe it is the Fountain of Life, wherein the Creatures, before their birth, and after their death, live; and, by a perpetual Miracle, enlivens all thoſe works it hath produced.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Imago iſta non falſa eſt, quia Veritas; non muta, quia Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum; non mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, quia Vita.</hi> Lib. de Incar. Verb.</note> This is it which S. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſaith with as much pomp of Eloquence, as Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Piety: This Image is not mute, becauſe it is the Word; not falſe, becauſe it is the Truth; not dead, becauſe it is Life.</p>
                  <p>This ſame Son, who is the Image of his Father, is by a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence the Idea of all the Creatures; they are all formed after this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Examplar; and according as they more or leſs participate of his like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are more or leſs noble in their nature: Men and Angels have no advantage above the reſt, but becauſe they are the Tranſcripts of this
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115672:165"/>Idea, and others at moſt but the Footſteps thereof. The Scripture teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that Man was formed after this primitive Image, that he was made after the ſimilitude thereof, and that in the very Creation he belonged not to the Father but by the mediation of the Son: This Greatneſs was the occaſion of his Fall: for, ſollicited by the devil, he was not content to be the Image of the Word, but would alſo be that of the Father, and pronounce theſe words, which are onely true in the mouth of the Son, <hi>Ego ſum ſimilis Altiſſimo.</hi> This Crime was the cauſe of his diſaſter: the Father, to revenge his Son, drove this Inſolent, that had encroached upon his rights, out of Paradiſe; and reduced Him to the condition of Beaſts, who had impudently aſpired to the equality of his Word. So great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had utterly ruined us, without any hope of recovery, had not the Son of God, who was the Innocent occaſion, been alſo the Charitable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: For ſeeing that men were become guilty in ſtriving to imitate him, that to revenge Him his Father had deſtroyed Them, he reſolved, ſaith S. <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Per me Pater recipiat quos propter me ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſe videtur; ecce, venio, &amp; talem me eis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibebo, ut quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis geſticrit imitari, fiat ei aemulatio in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> Bern.</note> to put himſelf in a condition wherein he may be ſecurely imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, and where the deſire of being like him being no longer a Crime, is become a means to arrive to happineſs. He was made Man, to ſerve for an Example to Man; he ſubmitted himſelf to his Father, to teach them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; he was abaſed to the ſhame of the Croſs, to teach them Humility; and he forgave his Executioners their putting him to death, to oblige them to pardon their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> diſcovering the ſecrets of Predeſtination, ſaith, that his deſigne is to render the Elect conformable to his Image, and to beſtow Graces upon them, which, ſatisfying their deſires, may make them, without committing a fault, like his onely Son. For this reaſon <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> ſays, that the ſame Eternal Father forming the body of the Firſt man at the Creation of the world,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quodcunque li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus exprimeba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, Chriſtus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitabatur homo futurus.</hi> Tert. de reſurrect. carn.</note> was taken up with Jeſus Chriſt; that the Slime repreſented him the Incarnation of his Word, and that, foreſeeing the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> he already provided him a remedy. It is true, then, that the Chriſtian is the Image of the Son of God, that Nature and Grace obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him to imitate this Pattern, and that his perfection conſiſts in the likeneſs he may have to this Model. Let us ſee then what it concerns him to do that he may gain it, and afterwards we will conſider the obligations ſo great an advantage requires at our hands.</p>
                  <p>Grace hath more analogie with Art then with Nature: For when this makes a man, at the ſame time ſhe is buſie about all the parts whereof he is compoſed: and, as if ſhe were afraid to make them jealous one of another, ſhe hollows the eyes when ſhe bores the ears, and faſhions the tongue as ſoon as the heart: But Art, leſs happie or leſs powerful then Nature, contrives her works ſucceſſively: one while ſhe makes a hand, and divides it into five fingers, whereby it becomes as uſeful as it is handſome; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently it opens an eye, then the mouth; and effecting that at divers turns which it could not do at once, finiſheth the Picture with much time and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115672:165"/>labour. Grace, imitating Art more then Nature, ſpends whole moneths to form Jeſus Chriſt in our ſouls: In our Birth we are but rude draughts of the New man; our vertues are not acquired all at an inſtant; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Grace finde reſiſtance in our Wills, or Concupiſcence combat her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, ſhe thinks her progreſs very conſiderable, if in a whole yeer ſhe can enrich us with one vertue; and having ſpent much ſweat to finiſh us, is obliged to ſay, by the mouth of S. <hi>Paul, Filioli, quos iterum parturio donec formetur in vobis Chriſtus.</hi> She calls us <hi>little,</hi> to teach us that we are ſtill growing; ſhe puts us in minde that ſhe ſtill travels with us, that we may comprehend 'tis at divers paſſes that ſhe brings us forth: ſhe ſays ſhe teems with us till Chriſt be again formed in our hearts, to perſwade us that our production is not wrought in a moment; and, to make us the Images of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhe muſt ſucceſſively employ the Lights of Faith, the Fervours of Charity, the Vigours of Repentance, and the Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Humility. For all this, it often falls out that the Chriſtian is not perfect when he dies, that he is but a defective Image of the Son of God, and that there is need for the flames of Purgatory to ſupply the negligence of our labour and the weakneſs of our vertue.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, if he will, during his life, make uſe of a double addreſs, and joyn two Arts together to expreſs Jeſus Chriſt in himſelf, he may make his deſignes happily ſucceed. Painting and Carving do both of them make Images; but the ways they take are extremely different: for the Carver uſeth nothing but the Chizel; he hews away whatever is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Marble or in the Wood; it ſeems to ſearch for the Statue in its matter, takes away that which covers it, ſtrips it to enrich it, deſtroys it to perfect it; and removes the form of a tree, or of a ſtone, onely to give it that of a Man, or of a Beaſt. The Painter goes a quite contrary way: for he finiſheth the Picture by laying Colour upon Colour, draws the Pencil a hundred times over his work, addes one daſh upon another; and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldening bright Colours by dark ones, extends Fields, depreſſeth Valleys, raiſeth Mountains, and does all thoſe wonders which couzen our eyes, and raviſh our underſtandings.</p>
                  <p>To the compleating of a Chriſtian, and to form the Image of Jeſus Chriſt in his ſoul, theſe two contrary arts muſt be aſſociated, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries induſtry and the Painters dexterity joyntly imitated;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sculptoris Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem imitetur Chriſtianus; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahat quotidie quod ſibi nocet, &amp; quod Deo diſplicet.</hi> Hugo de ſanct. Vict.</note> he muſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day lop off ſome imperfection, deface ſome bad habit, pare away ſome vitious inclination; and, as if he ſought for the beauty of Grace under the rubbiſh of Sin, remove whatever ſeems to hide it from us: But at the ſame time we muſt imitate the Painter, adde vertue to vertue, joyn pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to humility, heighten conſtancy by ſweetneſs, mingle many good works together, and by that pleaſing medley perfect the Image of Jeſus Chriſt. The Pencil-muſt be ſorted: with the Chizel; chop off, as-Carvers do, uſeleſs Pleaſures, ſuperfluous Riches, exceſſive Honours; and at the ſame time, like the Painter, adde the practiſe of vertue the exerciſe of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115672:166"/>good works, and the patient ſuffering of adveſities.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the moſt excellent diſpoſition is, ſo to engrave the Image of Jeſus Chriſt in our heart, that nothing can blot it out: We draw figures upon the ſand, but a little wind blows them away; we paint the water, but the leaſt ſtorm ſpoils our fancy; we cut in braſſe and marble, and theſe characters ſtand the fury of time, and endure many ages. The I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Jeſus Chriſt meets with all theſe different ſubjects in Chriſtians; ſometimes 'tis formed upon ſouls that have no more conſiſtence then the ſand, or waves; the wind of temptation ſcatters the impreſſions of grace, and the leaſt occaſion makes them loſe advantages they had received in the Sacrament of Repentance: There are others more conſtant which keep the form they have taken, who amidſt the ſtorms of grief preſerve the character they bear; and more laſting then braſſe, loſe not in the flames what they have received from the Sacraments: If we are of this number, there remains no more to make us perfect, but to render to Jeſus Chriſt the ſubmiſſions are due to him from his Images.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is to depend upon his will, and to acknowledge, that as we hold our being from his power, ſo we expect the preſervation thereof from his goodneſs. There are ſome pieces that ſurvive the Artiſts that have wrought them, and having been made by mortal hands, ceaſe not in ſome ſort to enjoy a kind of eternity: There are other images which cannot ſubſiſt but by thoſe that have given them their being; Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence produceth them in a Glaſs; our abſence quite defaceth them, and they ceaſe to live aſſoon as we ceaſe to inanimate them:

Leo.</note> Chriſtians are like theſe later Images; The preſence of Jeſus Chriſt is neceſſary for their preſervation, and the Grace that produced them is the ſame that preſerves and upholds them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond duty is to expreſs him ſo happily, that he may be ſeen in our perſon, and that we may be taken for ſecond Jeſus Chriſts; For if a picture be good, it makes us know him it repreſents; we ſee the lineaments of his face, obſerve his behaviour, and diſcover his very humours: If the Chriſtian be the Image of the Son of God, he muſt have his air, expreſſe his vertues, imitate his actions, and follow his motions.</p>
                  <p>The laſt duty of an Image, is to ſerve for the glory of him whom it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents; Could it ſpeak, it would publiſh nothing but his praiſes, and would witneſs that being only his, it eſpouſeth no other Intereſts but what are his. The Chriſtian is bound to be of the ſame mind, becauſe he is the Image of the Son of God; he ought to breath only after his honour, to act for his ſervice, to ſpeak for his glory; and as a Criminal whom the Prince hath pardoned, remains a living monument of his clemency: ſo a Chriſtian whom Jeſus Chriſt hath redeemed, is an inanimated picture of his mercy; nor ought to have any other deſign then by the luſtre of his actions to manifeſt the goodneſſe of his Divine Redeemer.</p>

                  <p>LOve hath made the Son of God ſo liberal, that he poſſeſſeth no quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he communicates not to the Chriſtians: If he be God by his Eſſence, we are by his Grace; if he be the Son of God by Nature, we are by Adoption; if he produce the holy Spirit from all Eternity, we produce him in Time; if he confer Grace in the ſtate of his Father, we confer it in his; if he be Prieſt and Victim in his Sacrifice, we partake theſe two qualities with him; and the Church bears no Chriſtians in her womb, who may not boaſt that in ſome ſort they are both Prieſts and Victims.

                  <p>Indeed the Fathers of the Church have profeſſed, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were Prieſts; that their Baptiſm was their Prieſthood;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sacerdotium Laico um Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſma.</hi> Hieron.</note> and that in this Sacrament which ſeparates them from the world, they were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Jeſus Chriſt; Therefore doth the great Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the <hi>Luciferians,</hi> honour the Laity with this title, and cals their Baptiſm their Prieſthood. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is of the ſame mind; and though he was not ignorant of the difference between the Laity and the Clergy, he forbears not to ſtyle all Chriſtian Prieſts, becauſe their Name denotes their Unction, and their Grace makes them the members of the High Prieſt Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And certainly, he that ſhall conſider the employments of Prieſts, will find that they are common to the Laity; and though they have neither their character nor their power, they are with them admitted into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Sacraments. They may adminiſter Baptiſm in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, communicate the Grace they have received, and bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Jeſus Chriſt: Though they are not raiſed to that pitch of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which makes the Prieſts Judges in the Tribunal of Repentance, and have not any Authority from the Son of God to remit ſins; nevertheleſſe it hath ſometimes fallen out, that the Faithful being not able to meet with a Prieſt, have confeſſed themſelves to Laicks, and the Laicks have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:115672:167"/>to obtain Grace for them by means of Prayer, which in ſome ſort ſupplies the vertue of Abſolution. Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> authoriſeth this cuſtome, and exhorts Soldiers that enter into the field, Mariners that are ſurpriſed with a ſtorm, not to neglect this remedy, and to fly to this kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, when they want the ordinary one: He confirms the uſe thereof by his reaſons, and tels us, that the ſorrow and the humility Chriſtians epxreſſe in this occaſion, is not unprofitable to draw down upon them the Divine mercie.</p>
                  <p>The Laity in ſome ſenſe may be ſaid to ſacrifice daily in our Churches; If they pronounce not the Sacramental words with the Prieſts, they joyn themſelves with their intentions, and accompanying them with their vows, have a ſhare in the producing of Jeſus Chriſt on our Altars: For the Prieſts repreſenting the whole Church in this Sacrament, they are the Syndics, or Proctors of the Faithful, acting in their name; they require their aſſiſtance, and conjure them to joyn with them in an action which equally concerns them all. All the words of the Maſſe confirm this truth; The confeſſion which is common to Prieſt and people teſtifies that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is common; The oblation of the Hoſt, wherein the Prieſt requires the attention and conſent of the people, is an evident proof of the part they bear in it; the very Canon wherein the Prieſt treats in ſecret with God, where he interpoſeth the credit of the Saints that reign in Heaven, authoriſeth this belief: For he ſpeaks in the name of the Faithful, and even then when he offers this ſacrifice in their behalf, teſtifies that he offers it with them, and that he is at the ſame time the Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt and of his Church.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Chriſtians are Prieſts as we have ſaid, becauſe they are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned daily to offer up ſacrifices;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Perum Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium eſt omne opus quod agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ut ſancta ſocietate haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus Deo.</hi> Aug.</note> and according to the language of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> all vertuous actions are ſo many holy oblations which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Eternal Father. He that ſings with the Prieſt, offers the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of praiſe; he that gives Alms to the poor, makes a ſacrifice of his goods; he that is ſorrowful for his ſins, offers a ſacrifice of his heart; and he that endeavours to waſh them away by his tears, offers a ſacrifice of his eyes: But not to reckon up all the actions of the Faithful, it is enough to ſay with the ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that their whole life is a ſacrifice, and that they begin to be Prieſts aſſoon as they begin to be Victims.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two qualities were inſeparable in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt; he bare them from the very firſt moment of his Incarnation; and aſſoon as ever he held the language of a Prieſt,

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115672:167"/>obliged to be Victims, and after the example of Jeſus Chriſt, they ought to find in their perſon the ſubject of their ſacrifice: They have no remainders of <hi>Adam,</hi> which may not happily be ſubſervient to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign: Whatever they hold of this wretched Father, ought to be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the flames of Juſtice or thoſe of Charity; Purgatory will burn that which the fire hath not; and Heaven finiſhing what theſe two had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But in expectation of this happy houre, they muſt begin their ſacrifice here; and by little and little deſtroying what is contrary to Grace, make Holocauſts of all their inordinate inclinations; For we learn from <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> that though we are no longer under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> we are not diſpenſed with for ſacrificing; but as the Law of Grace is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other, we ought to immolate all thoſe paſſions that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to us by the Beaſts they ſlaughtered at the foot of the Altar: We ſatisfie this duty when we ſet upon our criminal affections, and full of zeal and courage we endeavour to ſtifle them. We immolate a Bull when we tame our pride, and labour to kill this ſin that gives life to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; we ſacrifice a Goat when we quench the luſtful flames of impurity, and by a divine fire mortifie this infernal one, which devours all vertues; we ſlay a Ram when we ſubdue our anger, diſarm this ſeditious paſſion, calm this raging ſea, and manacle this fury which troubles the tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our mind; we offer Pigeons and Turtles, when we baniſh thoſe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile inordinations which divert us from piety, and engage our minds in the affairs of the world.</p>
                  <p>But if we have ſubjected our paſſions to the dominion of reaſon, and by a happy barrenneſs the Earth of our Intellectual part breeds no mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters which we may offer up to God; we muſt ſeek into our body, and of our members make innocent ſacrifices: For the great Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles teacheth us, that we are obliged to offer our bodies a lively ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and to pacifie the anger of Heaven by a holy oblation acceptable to him, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t exhibeatis corpora veſtra hoſtiam viventem;</hi> as if he would ſay, that we ought to die to ſin, that we may live to Grace; and the members which have ſerved heretofore to the tyranny of Concupiſcence, may now become ſerviceable to the lawful power of Charity: or, he would advertiſe us, that if in the Old Teſtament only dead Victims were offered up to God, in the New we muſt offer up living ones; and that mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion working in the Chriſtian what death did in the Beaſts, we muſt joyn the two ſacrifices together, and accord death with life to ſatisfie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice: Thus the whole exerciſe of a Chriſtian is to make war upon their bodies; and to gain victories over themſelves, they vanquiſh their enemies in facrificing their members, and they may boaſt that in offering ſacrifices to God, they erect trophies to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration of theſe Truths, me thinks we may ſay with <hi>Origen,</hi>
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:115672:168"/>that all the faithfull are Victims, and that in the difference of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they agree in this common quality: If any thing diſtinguiſh them, 'tis the degree of their love, and the perfection of their Sacrifice. The Apoſtles, ſaith He, were the firſt Victims, becauſe they forſook all to follow their Maſter; and having given him their heart by Charity, their ſpirit by Faith, their goods by Poverty, they moreover conſecrated their bodies by the Repentance of their life, and by the cruelty of their death: The Martyrs immediately ſucceed them, becauſe having a long time la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by Grief, at laſt they have perfected their ſacrifice by Martyrdom. The Virgins hold the Third place, becauſe they triumph over their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, tame a hundred ſeverall ways this domeſtick Enemy, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to conſecrate him by purity, borrow the aſſiſtance of pennance, to mortifie him by contrition; The Continent and the Married follow theſe cloſe; and if in their ſacrifice they deſtroy not the Victim, they put it at leaſt in a condition, that it no more rebels againſt the Sacrificers, and where it expects with patience for death,
<note place="margin">

Silence and Chaſtity were fruits of this Tree, which might be gathered to make an offering for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For though the Body be the leaſt part of man, 'tis not the moſt unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; its imperfections are advantageous to us; its rebellions ſerve us for Tryals; and Grace, which is ingenious, turns the moſt part of its miſeries into remedies. The infirmities which trouble its health, help our Sacrifice; and the diſeaſed perſon that ſuffers his afflictions patiently, is a victim: who though not innocent, is notwithſtanding well-pleaſing to Jeſus Chriſt. Poverty which ſtrips us of ſuperfluities, or of neceſſaries, which reduceth us to the condition our Birth found us in, and whither Death will bring us, is a ſacrifice which gains us as much merit, as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures us inconvenience.</p>
                  <p>Nay, Death it ſelf, which ſeems the eldeſt daughter of ſin, who ſhews all the horrours of her father upon her countenance, is not ſo much the deſtruction, as the ſacrifice of our Body: ſhe imitates the ſeverity of fire and ſword: ſhe, ſhe alone does what the knife and the pile of wood ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did; and reduceth the victim to aſhes, having deprived it of life: ſhe ſerves for the Divine Juſtice and Mercy together:

This is it that imprints ſo violent a deſire of Death in the hearts of the faithful; which makes them in the midſt of their proſperity call her in to their aſſiſtance, and wiſh, that comming to end their life, ſhe may come to perfect their ſacrifice: For it ſeems ſhe hath changed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſince Jeſus Chriſt conſecrated her in his perſon; ſhe is like thoſe waters that take the taſte and colour of thoſe Minerals through which they paſs; ſhe hath loſt all her gaſtlineſs, and hath ſome ſecret beauties which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115672:168"/>love in the ſoul of all Saints. She that led us to the gates of hell, lifts us up to heaven: ſhe that was the mother of ſhame and ſadneſs, is now the mother of joy and glory: ſhe that filled us with deſpair, buoys us up with hope: ſhe that eſtabliſhed the Empire of ſin, deſtroys it: in a word, ſhe that was the Chaſtiſement of our Crime, is now the Sacrifice of our Love.</p>
                  <p>For this end have all the greateſt Saints made the Panegyrick of death: they have rendered thanks to the Divine Juſtice that inflicts a puniſhment upon us which ſhortens our miſery, and advanceth our happineſs, which ſeparates us from the world, and unites us to Jeſus Chriſt; and under a falſe appearance of rigour, delivers us from the dangers that threaten us, the griefs that torment us, and the ſins that tyrannize over us. This made that famous Penitent ſay, He was juſt that expected death, but he was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that deſired it. Finally, this drew that Elogie out of the mouth of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> for, conſidering the advantages which he promiſed himſelf by death, how that it would unite him to Jeſus Chriſt, he called it, by a new name, his Gains and his Riches; it enters into his minde as the recompence of his travels, an indempnity for his loſſes, and the moſt aſſured purchaſe he could make in this world: <hi>Mihi vivere Chriſtus eſt, &amp; mori lucrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus every Chriſtian may eaſily become a Victim, becauſe death is a favourable occaſion; and being well managed, may ſerve to expiate our ſins, to ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice, and to imitate the charity of Jeſus. But the misfortune is, that Love is wanting in this Sacrifice; and, holding a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage far different from that of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> we are obliged to ſay, We finde the Sacrifice, but there is neither knife, nor fire to conſume it. Indeed, all men die, but few Chriſtians make good uſe of their death; and there are none but the Elect, who, turning it into a Holocauſt, know ſo well how to uſe it, that it opens them the gate of heaven.</p>

                  <p>THe God whom we adore takes his Glory as well from War as from Reſt; and if he be called in Scripture <hi>the God of peace,</hi> he is as often called <hi>the Lord of hosts:</hi> His Angels are the ſouldiers that wait upon him to the Battel, who avenge him of his enemies; <hi>Numquid eſt numerus mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ejus!</hi> the Stars, which keep watch as Sentinels about his Palace, bear the name of the <hi>Militia</hi> in the language of the Prophets; <hi>Militia coelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum:</hi> and all thoſe that ſerve him for Miniſters in his Embaſſies, ſerve him
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115672:169"/>for Combatants in his Conqueſts. Therefore did the Angels who gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Shepherds of the birth of Jeſus Chriſt, take their name from their principal employment, and called themſelves the heavenly Hoſt, <hi>Multitudo Militiae coelſtis:</hi> and when the Son of God was taken in the garden of Olives, and blamed Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who would have hindered the work of our Salvation, he told his diſciples that it was eaſie for him to ask of his Father legions of Angels to defend him from his enemies.</p>
                  <p>Men are conſidered under this quality upon earth; the holy Scripture calls them Souldiers; and if we believe the teſtimony of <hi>Job,</hi> their whole life is a continual warfare: They have as many Enemies as Subjects: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion is ſpread over every corner of their State; the parts whereof they are compoſed, are revolted; and, which way ſoever they turn themſelves, they finde occaſions of Fighting. Chriſtians are yet more obliged to War then Men: the Sacrament, that enables them, withal engageth them into the combat:
<note place="margin">

Proſp.</note> The Earth is the Field where they try the Maſtery; and theſe terms of a Liſt, a Crown, a Souldier, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often uſeth in his Epiſtles, are ſo many proofs of ſo known a Truth: The Church it ſelf is an Army, the Chriſtians whereof it is formed are the Souldiers; and the Scripture deſcribes her in arms in theſe words, <hi>Terribilis ut Caſtrorum acies ordinata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein it ſeems we may behold the difference between a Camp and a City: Both of them are Bodies which have their Head and Members, their Laws and Policie, their deſignes and employments: But in Cities we obſerve a pleaſing variety of conditions equally contributing to their advantage and beauty: There we ſee Prieſts, who chant forth the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of God in his Temple, who load his Altars with offerings; and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their tears with the blood of the Victims, endeavour to appeaſe his juſt indignation: There are Magiſtrates which end Controverſies, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Peace among the People, and make Juſtice raign in Families: There are Merchants which traffick with ſtrangers; who, by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, occaſion Plenty, and by their diligence ſupply all neceſſities. But difference of condition ſeems to be baniſhed from Armies: as all fight, ſo all are ſouldiers: thoſe that command, and thoſe that obey, bear this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and both of them place their glory in their valour. Therefore the Church being an Army, thoſe it conſiſts of muſt neceſſarily fight: the moſt feeble muſt be courageous; the women muſt be <hi>Amazones;</hi> and all Chriſtians, forgetting the difference of their conditions, muſt take upon them the quality of Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Enemies will not be wanting to exerciſe their courage, becauſe the World, the Fleſh and the Devil hold intelligence to ſet upon them: For the Chriſtians war is at home; whatever he hath received from <hi>Adam,</hi> is an occaſion of exerciſing him; and, for a puniſhment of his ſin, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to fight with himſelf. The Fleſh is never at agreement with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; theſe two parties have always ſome difference to compoſe; and though
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115672:169"/>linkt together by natural chains, and common intereſts, ceaſe not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to make war upon one another: They are two friends that uſually fall out, and two enemies that careſs each other; two friends that ſhake hands, and two enemies that make mutual viſits; two friends that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure one another, and two enemies that can never be aſunder. This diviſion is the firſt puniſhment of our ſin: and when we began to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ill terms with God, we ceaſed to have any good correſpondence with our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſeems moſt troubleſom, is, that one Combat furniſheth us with many enemies: for, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, we daily fight in our heart; in ſuch a little room we finde whole armies; and ſometimes we grapple with Avarice, ſometimes with Pride, ſometimes with Impurity: ſo that 'tis very hard, being ſet upon by ſo many enemies, if we receive not ſome wound: This Combat is obſtinately diſputed: if there be ſome Truce, there is no real Peace: it laſts till death; and if ſoul and body be not ſeparated, it is impoſſible to make them friends: The Senſes bring us falſe reports, the Paſſions raiſe ſtorms, our Inclinations ſet up a party; and, to defend us from ſo many enemies, we are obliged to borrow the aſſiſtance of Vertue. Every Age hath its exerciſe: Infancy is oppreſſed with Errour and Ignorance, Youth is baited with Ambition and Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Old-age is clogged with Anger and Peeviſhneſs; ſo that there is no condition but hath need of Grace, to defend it from thoſe enemies that ſet upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Devil takes part with the Body to deſtroy us, employs his wiles or his force to terrifie or ſeduce us; he mingles himſelf with our Humours, diſorders our Paſſions, troubles our Temper; and, as if he were the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign of Man, as well as the Prince of the World, he deboiſts our Subjects, to diſquiet our Reſt. Sometimes he takes upon him the ſhape of a Lion, and ſometimes that of a Serpent, that uſing ſubtilty and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, he may gain ſome advantage upon us: He ſtudies our inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to deſtroy us; ſuits himſelf with our humours, to ſurpriſe us; and, regulating his promiſes according to our deſires, propounds Honours to us if ambitious, Riches if covetous, Pleaſures if wanton: He perſwades us that our Revenges are juſt, our Inclinations reaſonable, and our Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations innocent; and hiding Vice under the mantle of Vertue, hinders us from reforming or defending our ſelves. To ſecure us from ſo redoubted an enemy, who ſets upon us ſo many different ways, we muſt oppoſe our Prudence againſt his Cunning, our Patience againſt his Fury: we muſt countermine his Stratagems, penetrate his Intentions, and diſcover the hook which lies under the ſugar'd bait: we muſt alſo bleſs the Juſtice of God, who exerciſeth us by the cruelty of this Executioner; put our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his goodneſs, and remember that in this Conflict we can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come onely by ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>Having obtained this victory, we muſt arm our ſelves againſt the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:115672:170"/>world, which is the moſt dangerous enemy the Chriſtian can have: He ſet upon Jeſus Chriſt in his birth, and being true to his Tyrant, knew not his lawful Soveraign even then when he came to be his deliverer; <hi>In mundo erat, &amp; mundus eum non cognovit:</hi> He perſecuted him during his life, nor loſt any occaſion wherein he might doe him a miſchief; <hi>Mundus me odit:</hi> He conſpired his death with the Devils, and expreſſing himſelf by the mouth of the Scribes and Phariſes, charged him with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies before the Tribunal of <hi>Pilate,</hi> caſt fear into the ſoul of that cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Judge, and forced him to condemn a man whom he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed innocent. Therefore neither had Jeſus Chriſt any commerce with the world, he proteſted he had nothing to doe with it, <hi>Ego non ſum de mundo;</hi> and that contrary his to maxims, he could neither approve nor ſuffer it: He would not ſo much as pray for it, when he prayed for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners, <hi>Non pro mundo rogo:</hi> He boaſted in the preſence of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that he had ſubdued this rebel, and defeated this enemy, <hi>Confidite, ego vici mundum;</hi> Finally, he promiſed his Diſciples, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the world in the dreadful day of his vengeance; ſo that profeſſing to imitate the Son of God, we are obliged to hate what he never loved, and to defend our ſelves from a Traitor, who employs lying, grief, and pleaſure to gain us to his party.</p>
                  <p>He tries to deceive us, that ſo he may corrupt us; he ſets up Maxims which under a pretence of maintaining ſociety, introduce Libertiniſme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; he makes debauches paſſe for recreations, revenge for great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of courage,

He lays before their eyes whatever may allure them; makes pleaſure enter in at their ſenſes; and forgetting no artifice to render wickedneſſe agreeable, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens his Empire, and encreaſeth the number of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>If we be Chriſtians indeed, we muſt combat this enemy, oppoſe the Maxims of the Goſpel againſt his falſhoods; deſtroy error by truth; &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that being the ſubjects of Jeſus Chriſt, we acknowledge no other Laws but thoſe of his Church: To evacuate thoſe terrors wherewith he ſhakes
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:115672:170"/>our courage, we muſt diſcern true honour from falſe, fixe our glory in our duty; and remember, that the true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, ought always to prefer vertue before honour, and conſcience before reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To defend us from the pleaſures the world tempts us with, we muſt look upon their end, and repreſent the ſhame and grief that never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes them: Finally, we muſt beg Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, who hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the world; that aſſiſted with his favour we may vanquiſh his enemies with all the errours wherewith he would ſeduce us, the fear wherewith he would aſtoniſh us, and the pleaſures wherewith he would enchaunt us.</p>
                  <p>For it is not enough for the Chriſtian to be a ſoldier, if he be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo victorious; his condition is more painful then that of ſoldiers: For though theſe are the Victims of Glory and of Death, that for a little pay they expoſe themſelves to a thouſand dangers, they are not reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for the ſucceſſe of the battle; and provided they lend their heart and hand to their General, there is nothing more can be expected from their valour. But the Chriſtians are ſuch ſoldiers as muſt be victorious, 'tis not enough that they fight, they muſt win the field, they muſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come here, if they mean to-reign with Chriſt hereafter: 'Tis true, he hath this advantage over all other Captains, he inſpires courage into his ſoldiers, and gives them victory who engage in the combat; ſo that 'tis their fault if they be defeated, and the glory of their Commander if they remain Conquerours: Their birth obligeth them to this duty; for the Scripture teacheth us,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>The vertues themſelves they have received at their Baptiſm, are helps which facilitate the defeat of their enemies; For faith is not only their ſtrength but their victory, and renders them as well Conquerours as Soldiers; Hope heightens their Courage, and giving them the Almighty for their Second, makes them gain as many Victories as they fight Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tails. Charity that finds nothing impoſſible, which meaſures its power by its courage, and more prevalent then death, overturns whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts it, inſpires them with ſo much force, that they vanquiſh all griefs, and maſter all difficulties: But if there be any vertue that renders them invincible, we muſt confeſſe 'tis their deſpoiling themſelves of the goods of the Earth; For Satan never catcheth us but by thoſe things that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us; he ſeduceth only by thoſe things that pleaſe us, and when ſelf-denial hath perfectly ſeparated us, they loſe the boldneſſe to ſet upon us, and the hope of overcoming us. Therefore doth S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> admirably conclude, that he that only loves that good which cannot be taken from
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:115672:171"/>him is truly invincible: and <hi>Seneca</hi> founded upon the ſame principle had reaſon to ſay, that <hi>Alexander</hi> was vanquiſhed by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> becauſe he found a Philoſopher to whom he could give nothing, and from whom he could take nothing away.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the ambitious are not ſubdued, but becauſe they are afraid to loſe their honour; the immodeſt are not gain'd, but becauſe they have a mind to preſerve their love; nor are the covetous engaged in injuſtice, but becauſe they cannot reſolve to part with riches. But the Saints who are wedded only to God, laught at Tyrants and Devils; and cruelty being not able to raviſh from them what they love, they happily aſſociate the quality of Conquerour with that of a Soldier. Let us adde, that the believer is invincible, if he be perfectly united to Jeſus Chriſt; our ſtrength depends upon this union, and when the Devil breaks the ſecured bonds, he hath an advantage againſt us. He defeated us in the perſon of <hi>Adam;</hi> he vanquiſhed all men in one; he gain'd a hundred victories in one duel: But he hath loſt all his advantages againſt Jeſus Chriſt; in him we are Conquerours; and as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, his victory would not be perfect if he did not ſtill conquer the world in his members: Let us therefore unite our ſelves to him, that we may be invincible. When we feel the ſolicitations of the fleſh or the Devil, and theſe two Tyrants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate together endeavour to over-power us, let us implore the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our Head, and nothing preſuming upon our own abilities, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing our ſelves all from his Grace, render the honour to him of whom we hold the victory.</p>

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115672:171"/>his Mother proteſts, ſhe will be his Handmaid; and that the dignity wherewith ſhe was honoured, ſhall never make her leave the affections of a ſervant, <hi>Ecce Ancilla Domini:</hi> But becauſe there are many conditions of Servitude, it is fit to take notice of them in this Diſcourſe, and to ſee what ſort that of the Chriſtians ought to be.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is founded in Nature, we bear the Character of it in our very eſſentials, we are Gods Vaſſals, becauſe we are his Creatures; there is no Greatneſs can give us a diſpenſation from this Thraldome: Kings are obedient to his will, their hearts are in his hands; and as there is in every thing a ſecret obedience, which maugre the proper inclination ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it to the power of the Creator; ſo there is in every man a naturall ſubmiſſion, which without violating his Liberty, makes him ſtoop to the command of the Almighty. The ſecond Servitude ſomewhat different from the former, is a forced ſubjection, making Caitiffs obey their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, even whilſt they reſiſt him; to follow his Ordinances whilſt they contemn his laws; and to be ſerviceable to his Juſtcie, when they would not be wrought upon by his Mercy. The third is a Servitude ariſing from fear, which makes ſlaves more ſollicitous after their own intereſt, then the glory of their Maſter, and are more apprehenſive of the puniſhment then of the ſin. Theſe ſlaves are guilty in his eyes, who reads their ſouls; if their hands or mouth be Innocent, their heart is Criminall, and if they commit not the act of ſin, they preſerve the deſire of it in the inmoſt receſſes of their Will. The fourth and laſt Servitude is voluntary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe amorous; theſe ſlaves love their maſter,
<note place="margin">

                  <p>Slaves labour not but for their maſter; they till the ground, but reap not the fruits; they plant vineyards, and drink not of the wine; they ſuffer much pain, and another taſtes the pleaſure: They are not as wives called in to a community of Goods, they are not as Children admitted to ſhare in the inheritance; and by a misfortune which ſeems to violate all the Laws of Nature, they neither diſpoſe of their eſtate nor of their perſons: But the ſlaves of the ſon of God finde riches in their ſervitude; their Maſter adopting them for his children, makes them his Heirs, and before he gives them his Glory for their Portion, gives them the diſpoſall of the Earth for Aſſurance: For theſe Great Saints who may be called the Royall ſlaves of the ſon of God bear rule in his State; The ſun riſeth only to enlighten them, the Earth is fruitfull for no other end but to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh them; Kings reign to be their Conductors; Tyrants are their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, only to exerciſe them; and whole Nature travels for their glory and their ſalvation: The ſeaſons reſpect their Commands, diſeaſes obey
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115672:172"/>their words, theſe animated Nothings which being the works of ſin, ſhould not in reaſon acknowledg their power, are ſubject to their Empire; and the Miracles theſe work in the world, are proofs that their ſervice puts them in poſſeſſion of all the goods of their Maſter.

                  <p>But we need not wonder if theſe ſlaves are rich, becauſe they are free; and that the ſame quality which inſtates them in plenty, puts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to liberty. Man is ſo free that he cannot be compell'd; Sin that deprives him of Grace, robs him not of his Liberty; and into whatever condition he throws himſelf, is ſtill his own Maſter. It is true, that according to the language of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> he becomes the ſlave of ſin, and free from Grace when he becomes Guilty; and on the contrary, free from ſin, and the fervant of Grace when juſtified: Although in theſe two ſtates ſo oppoſite, Liberty is always mixt with Servitude; St <hi>Thomas</hi> and St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with whom we cannot eaſily miſtake, teach us, That in the ſtate of ſin there is a reall Thraldome, and a falſe Liberty, becauſe man departing from God, wanders from his duty; and ſubjecting himſelf to his paſſions, is a ſlave in earneſt, and free only in appearance: On the contrary, there is a reall liberty in the ſtate of Grace, and an apparent ſervitude, becauſe Man does what he will, in that he does what he ought: that he is free becauſe reaſonable, and maſter of himſelf, becauſe the ſlave of Jeſus Chriſt. This is it that the Word Incarnate had a minde to teach us with his own mouth, when he ſaid, <hi>We ſhould be free indeed, if the Son made us free;</hi> and this is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> would have us underſtand by thoſe excellent words; We were the ſlaves of ſelf-love, and now that we are made free, we may boaſt that we are the Slaves of Charity: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any Divine that does not acknowledg, that our will is never more free,

                  <p>But that we may rightly conceive of the Greatneſſe of this Priviledg, we muſt remember that Servitude is the daughter of Sin, that men were not ſlaves till they became Guilty, and that Nature which laboured to equal their Conditions, is not ſhe that created this ſhamefull difference, which diſtinguiſheth them one from another. They were all Kings before their Defection, Innocence was the character of their Royalty; and as long as
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115672:172"/>they were the Images of God, they were his Vicegerents in the world; But ſin that deprived them of Grace, raviſh'd from them their Liberty, gave them as many Maſters as they have bad inclinations; and making this misfortune paſſe from their perſon into their eſtate, many times impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Tyrants over them, under a colour of conſtituting lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.</p>
                  <p>We had for ever remained in this ſhamefull Bondage, had not the ſon of God, who draws our ſalvation out of our fall, made us recover Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by Servitude: For Grace bringing us in ſubjection unto his will, hath put all Creatures under us; his love ſubjecting our ſoul to his Empire, hath made us the Maſters of our Body: this inſolent ſlave is is become obedient; and as it revolted not againſt the ſoul, but becauſe the ſoul was revolted againſt God; it returned to its duty, as ſoon as ſhe betook her ſelf to her reſpect; and acknowledged his Soveraign, as ſoon as ſhe acknowledged her Creator. Thus our Rule is founded upon our ſubmiſſion, our Liberty eſtabliſhed upon our vaſſalage, and we command our Body, becauſe we obey our God.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:115672:173"/>he deſired his Thraldom might be natural,
<note place="margin">Partus ſequitur ventrem.</note> and that the ſame mother that made him a Man, might make him his Fathers Servant: and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that he is liable to this condition, becauſe all Laws ordain that the Childe is of the ſame quality with the Mother: It ſeems ſhe had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired him with this deſire, in giving him a being; and that at the ſame time ſhe conceived him, ſhe imprinted in his ſoul the minde of a Slave.</p>
                  <p>The Naturaliſts aſſure us that Mothers have ſo much power over the bodies of their children in the moment of conception,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matres dum concipiunt, foeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus deſiderioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſigna quaedam inurunt.</hi> Plin.</note> that they expreſs upon them their Longings and Imaginations; and thoſe extraordinary marks they bring along with them into the world, are certain proofs of ſo known a Truth. But the Scripture acquaints us that the Virgin, more happie and more powerful then other mothers, hath made an impreſſion upon the ſoul and body of her onely Son; and having conceived him in the humble apprehenſions of a handmaid, as her laſt words to the Angel ſufficiently teſtifie, <hi>Ecce Ancilla Domini,</hi> ſhe infuſed her holy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, who, as a faithful Eccho, repeating the words of his mother, proteſted he would be his Fathers Servant. Therefore there is no Chriſtian who ought not to eſteem a Quality com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with the Son of God; which, though it were not ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in yeelding complacency would appear ſufficiently agreeable.</p>
                  <p>Servitude hath always this misfortune, that it makes us regret the loſs of Liberty; whatever charms it uſeth to ſweeten our diſcontents, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways troubleſome when forced: A Chain, though of Diamonds, is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and no ornament, if it load us; the ſtatelieſt Palace loſeth its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, when it becomes our priſon; and wherever there is compulſion, we finde pain and ſorrow.

In the mean time, the love of Liberty hath made ſome Slaves utterly abominate it; and in thoſe Countries where it is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, where they make it the manacles of offenders, 'tis inſupportable to the wretched inhabitants: They complain when they are adorned with it; that which is the pompous dreſs of our Kings, is their torment: becauſe this Metal engageth them to Bondage, it is the object of their hate; and Nature hath found out an innocent artifice to render it odious to theſe Captives.</p>
                  <p>But though Servitude be ſo grievous, it loſeth its bitterneſs when vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary; Love, without breaking their Chains, ſweetens them; and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Charms with their Weight, makes them ſo welcome, that there is not one Slave would recover his Liberty. Ask all ſinners, who live in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, you ſhall not finde one that complains of his Irons: every one ſeeks to adde to their weight, or to tye them faſter; and, as if their Paſſion had

Who doubts but that a Wanton is captivated with the beauty he idolizeth? Who knows not, by his complaints, that he hath loſt his Liberty, that he wears the Colours of his Miſtreſs as a Slave thoſe of his Maſter, and that all the actions he does are ſo many proofs of his Slavery? In the mean time, he loves his Priſon, boaſts of his Captivity, and is proud of his Miſery; he would not change condition with a Monarch.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as the Grace of the Son of God is nothing but Love, it knows the way of mixing Sweetneſs with Servitude; it makes us ſlaves in ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to his will; it triumphs over our Liberty, becauſe it is victorious; it impriſons us, becauſe we are made its Captives, by being delivered from the Tyranny of ſin: <hi>Captivam duxit Captivitatem:</hi> But it is agreeable, becauſe amorous; amorous, becauſe voluntary; and charms our diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, becauſe it ſweetly inchants our Wills. It hath no Slaves that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of their Bondage, or regret their Liberty: if they expreſs any ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, 'tis becauſe they are not yet fully under the dominion of Jeſus Chriſt: if they are big with any deſires, 'tis, that they may ſee themſelves in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie impotency to break their chains, and to be ſo ſtrongly faſtned to their Maſter, that, as S. <hi>Paul,</hi> they may bid defiance to all Creatures, and ſay with that great Apoſtle, that they cannot ſeparate them from their divine Redeemer.

                  <p>THough there be nothing in God which is not God himſelf, and his Unity which forbids us to divide him, ſuffers us not to know him: Nevertheleſs, the Scripture teacheth us to diſtinguiſh his perfections, to compare one with another, and to give them the advantage which ſeems
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115672:174"/>moſt conducing to his glory, or to our profit. There is none but ſees that our intereſts oblige us to prefer Mercy before Juſtice; that being laden with miſeries and crimes, we love the one, becauſe it aſſiſts the diſtreſſed, and fear the other, becauſe it puniſheth offendors. Following this principle, I conceive I may give Holineſs the preheminence over all the perfections of God; becauſe uniting our intereſts with his, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes moſt to his Glory and our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>'Tis this to ſpeak truly that ſeparates God from his works; which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his reſpect in preſerving his Majeſty; and which putting him at a diſtance from us, confines him within himſelf: Therefore may we ſay, it repairs the wrong his immenſity ſeems to do to him; For though this noble perfection ſcatters him over all the corners of his ſtate, raiſeth him into Heaven, and leads him into Hell; nevertheleſſe it engageth him in creatures which are unworthy to poſſeſſe him; and though this effuſion of himſelf be as well a mark of his Greatneſſe as of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the underſtanding of man can hardly comprehend that the Divine Majeſty is not intereſſed when it is in the Intellect of a Devil, or in the heart of a ſinner; we have much adoe to ſuffer his Omnipotence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate an impious perſon, to move the tongue of a blaſphemer, to guide the hand of a parrcide, and not to be wanting to the Laws he hath been pleaſed to preſcribe himſelf to aſſiſt the guilty when they offend: But his Holineſs ſecures him from theſe outrages, removes ſinners farre from him,

                  <p>This Attribute is not leſſe delicate then zealous; all tranſgreſſions ſcandalize it; nor does any thing bear the ſtamp of ſin, that does not offer it violence: ſhe hath more enemies then the reſt of her ſiſters, and if the other perfections of God are diſhonoured by ſome particular crimes, this is by all inquities of what kind ſoever. Thoſe that ſin of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pretend to find their excuſe in the cauſe of their offence, daſh only upon the power of the Almighty: Thoſe that ſin out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and conceive themſelves not guilty, becauſe they are blind, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend only the wiſdom of God: Thoſe that tranſgreſs out of malice, and who are leſs excuſable, becauſe more enlightned, wound only the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; and though ſo highly criminal, perſwade themſelves that wronging but one of his perfections, the reſt will be favourable towards them. But all ſinners together injure Holineſs; and as there is not one who turns not his back upon the Creator to embrace the creature, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any that diſhonours not this Attribute, whoſe principal deſign is to unite them to their Creator.</p>

                  <p>This firſt diſpoſition is not the only abnegation the Son of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us; it ſerves but for a ſtep to aſcend to a more difficult one, and having injoyn'd us the contempt of riches, obligeth us to deny our ſelves. 'Tis not enough to be admitted into his School, for a man to forſake his goods; he muſt withall renounce his inclinations, and purſuing the evil into its very root, offer up his will for an Holocauſt.

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:115672:175"/>with glory, that they contentedly part with all riches. The Prodigal ſeem as it were angry with money; and the laviſh expences they make, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies they more undervalue then prize them: But both of them are wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to themſelves; the more they ſtrip themſelves of their goods, the more are they wrapt up in their inclinations; and the leſs they have of avarice, the more are they puft up with pride and vain-glory: Therefore is it that the Son of God willing wholly to to cure man, paſſeth from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty to Self-denial; and having counſelled us to part with our riches, commands us to ſhake hands with our ſelves. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> following the ſteps of his Maſter, teacheth us, that they only who have crucified the fleſh with the luſts thereof, deſerve the name of Chriſtians; and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elſewhere of himſelf, witneſſeth, that to live to God, he was bound to crucifie himſelf with Jeſus Chriſt: He makes them paſs for enemies to the Croſs, who love themſelves; and not content to declaim againſt uncleanneſs, makes an invective againſt thoſe ſtately ſins, which including man within himſelf, left him not above the degree of beaſts, but to equal him with Devils: Finally, he will have all thoſe who are riſen with the Son of God to be taken up with the contempt of the Earth, and to be quickned with the deſires of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Though this firſt condition of Holineſs gives us occaſion to ſee, that there are very few Saints in the world; the ſecond, which is union with God, will more ſtrongly perſwade us of it: For ſin being nothing but a ſeparation from God, holineſs which is ſo oppoſite thereto, is nothing but an alliance with God: Thoſe that are moſt united to him, are the greateſt Saints; nor does any thing more gloriouſly diſtinguiſh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from Philoſophers, then this happy connexion. Every Sect hath formed an Idea of the ſupream good, and done their utmoſt to faſten their Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to it. The Epicures who acknowledge no other good but voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, had no other paſſion but for this Goddeſs: The Stoicks who adored nothing but the mind, ſpent all their veneration upon this Idol; and the Academicks who doated only upon Morall vertue, laboured meerly to gain her: But Chriſtians who know that pleaſure makes none but effeminate, that the love of underſtanding renders men arrogant, and that of vertue it ſelf when it mounts not high enough, makes only idolaters ſet their affections upon the ſupream good; and ſeeking their felicity in God, ſay with <hi>David, Mihi autem adhaerere Deo bonum eſt.</hi> 'Tis in this point properly that holineſſe conſiſts; he that wiſheth any thing elſe is blind or wretched; and he that waſts himſelf with other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, is not yet fully informed that the ſupream good is the end and reſt of the Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is it that Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaking to his Auditors, uttered theſe notable words: Let us be grieved to ſee men diſtracted with the diverſity of their deſires; Let us ſee their different conditions which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the difference of their deſigns: Let ſome take arms, and ſeek
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115672:175"/>for Glory in the mouth of Danger, hazard their lives to get themſelves a Name, and place their happineſſe in killing and ſlaying: Let others more harmleſſe, but not leſſe ambitious, plead at the Barr, gain reputation in defending Innocence, and aſpire to the Glory of Orators, being not able to purchaſe that of Conquerors: Let others more humble, but not leſſe intereſſed, hold commerce and Traffique with Strangers, paſſe the Seas to content their Avarice, deſcend into the bowels of the Earth to dig out Treaſures: Let others more Innocent, but not leſſe miſerable, till the ground, maſter barrenneſs by their laborious Improvement, and at the years end reap a rich and plentifull harveſt: Let all theſe different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions divide the heap of periſhable Goods between them; but let Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, inſtructed in a better School, proteſt that God is their portion, and that now and for ever, they will have no other Inheritance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words inſinuate to us the laſt circumſtance of Holineſs, which is not true, if it be not Conſtant and pertinent: A little to clear this Truth, we muſt know, there is no Chriſtian that is not united to God: the Character he received in his Baptiſm, is a mark of his dependance; Faith which he retains with ſin, is a ſacred tye faſtning him to Jeſus Chriſt, and gives him the honour to be a member of his Body; Charity is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bond, compleating what the others have begun, which knits him ſo cloſe to his Head, that their Good and Evill are indiviſible: But if the Chriſtian intend to be Holy, Perſeverance muſt ſecond Charity, and this faithfull vertue link them ſo conſtantly to the ſon of God, that nothing can ſeparate them: Many heard his words, admired his miracles, loved his perſon, who becauſe they fell off attained not to that excellent title of Saints.</p>
                  <p>'Tis this laſt Condition which Crownes Holineſſe, the ultimate Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter diſtinguiſhing the Elect from the Reprobate: Finally,

It being the immutable Decree of Gods good will and pleaſure, which makes men Saints and bleſſed: It is by vertue of this Eternal ordinance that they reſiſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ouer-rule Tyrants, and vanquiſh Devils.</p>
                  <p>'Tis by vertue of this internall Grace that they defie all Creatures, and ſay with Saint <hi>Paul, That nothing can ſeparate them from Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> I am ſure, ſaith that Great Apoſtle, that Death with his terrors, Life with
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:115672:176"/>its charms, Angels with their beauties, Devils with their deformities, Things preſent with their allurements, Things future with their promiſes, Heaven with its glory, Hell with its torment, can never ſeparate me from the love of God. And indeed how ſhould they, ſaith St <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> becauſe Death though never ſo hideous, leads us to Him; Life is found in his poſſeſſion, Angels and Devils are the Miniſters of his Juſtice or of his mercy, Things preſent are falſe, Things to come uncertain, Hell with God would be my Happineſſe, and Paradiſe without him my Torment.</p>
                  <p>Or if we will take this paſſage another way, let us ſay again with Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> That nothing can ſeparate us from Jeſus Chriſt; Not Death, becauſe there is none ſo diſmall as to be deprived of his Love; Not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, becauſe being united to him we are ſtronger then all Spirits combined together; Not the vexations of life, becauſe they are ſweet when under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for his Honour, and ſerve only to give us a nearer conjunction to his perſon; Not things to come, becauſe nothing can be beſtowed nor promiſed which can countervail him; Not Heaven, becauſe it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of thoſe that ſerve him; Not Hell, becauſe it is made for none but thoſe that forſake him. From all this Diſcourſe it is eaſie to judge, that the perfect Chriſtian is a Saint; that he ought to be wholly unbot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed from all things, and ſo cloſely united to Jeſus Chriſt, that nothing can remove him: But 'tis eaſie to judge withall, that we are at a great diſtance from Holineſs, becauſe a ſmall Intereſt, a weak Temptation, a ſhameful pleaſure, a light Injury ſeparates us daily from him, for whom we ought to ſacrifice our Intereſts, renounce our pleaſures, ſubdue our Temptations, and forget our Injuries.</p>

                  <p>THe condition of Chriſtians would be very miſerable, did their vertue depend upon their Enemies, and were they ſo ſtreightened that they could not compaſs the Crown of Martyrdom, but muſt be beholding to the Cruelty of Tyrants: But the Peace of the Church hath her Martyrs, as well as her Perſecution: Love is witty enough to exerciſe their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, without employing the fury of Infidels; Every Chriſtian may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Impiety, be his own Executioner; and provided he live according to the Laws the ſon of God hath preſcribed him, will finde his puniſhment in his obedience. All the vertues of Chriſtianity will aſſiſt him in this deſigne; Every Maxime of the Goſpel will make a part in his Agony: and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115672:176"/>having practiſed all that Jeſus Chriſt commands or counſels, he may boaſt, though he be an unprofitable ſervant, he ceaſeth not to be a faithful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</p>
                  <p>For if it be true that the Cauſe and the Puniſhment makes the Martyrs, we muſt confeſs that all they that live according to the Laws of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may lawfully pretend to this glorious quality: becauſe they ſuffer much, and for the height of their happineſs, they ſuffer for the Son of God: This laſt condition is ſo neceſſary, that, in the judgement of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> 'tis not ſo much the Puniſhment, as the Cauſe, that makes the Martyr. The Gally-ſlaves that tug at the Oar, the Captives that pine away for the loſs of Liberty in priſons, and thoſe Miſcreants that are broken upon the Wheel, endure the extremity of Torments: but becauſe their ſin is the cauſe of their puniſhment, they may be ſufferers, but they cannot be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs.

                  <p>But, not to betray the Cauſe that I defend, I am obliged to ſay, that, to be vertuous, is title enough to be a Martyr: For, ſince Nature is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſin, there is no Vertue that is not accompanied with Grief: We learn Vices without a Maſter; we carry the ſeeds of them in our ſouls; and, preventing bad examples, we act wickedneſs before we have ſeen it: But Chriſtian vertues are ſo difficult, that their conqueſt coſts us much labour and travel: we learn them with much ado, forget them eaſily; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them with care; neither is it Nature nor Art, but Grace and Sorrow that forms the Habit in us: They croſs our Inclinations; we muſt fight to gain them: and ſeeing wickedneſs is paſſed into our Nature, Vertues are become our Torments.</p>
                  <p>The Darkneſs we come into the world with, clouds the light of our Prudence: the infirmities we have inherited from our firſt Father, make
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115672:177"/>the victory over Strength extremely difficult: Intereſt, which is inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Self-love, is an oppoſition naturally ſet againſt Juſtice; and this heat, without which we cannot live, and by a deplorable unhappineſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains the flames of Impurity, is an obſtacle to Continence: It produceth thoughts which ſtain the luſtre of this Vertue, motions which trouble its reſt: ſo that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> had great reaſon to ſay, that of all the Trials of a Chriſtian, the moſt furious was that of Chaſtity, where the Conflict is ſo long, the Victory ſo rare, and the Danger ſo great: I would adde to the words of this holy man, without varrying much from his conceit, that 'tis the ſharpeſt Martyrdom a Believer can endure, becauſe he confeſſeth in another place, that, to mortifie the Fleſh, to tame Pride, makes up the beſt part of the Martyr: 'Tis perhaps upon this ground that the rigid <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who hath defended the advantages of Chaſtity with the prejudice of Truth it ſelf, hath acknowledged this vertue ſo auſtere, that 'tis eaſier to die for her,

                  <p>If having conſidered the ſeverity of the Vertues, we conſider the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the Goſpel, we ſhal finde it cannot be obeyed without the badg of Martyrdom: Every People hath its Laws; and there are none ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, whom Nature or Cuſtom have not furniſhed with ſome Policy. The Greeks lived according to the Laws of their Sages: The Romanes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Twelve Tables; and thoſe that had neither Kings nor Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers, have had for their guide the light of Nature, which is a relique of Innocence: The Jews were governed by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which, if it gave them not ſtrength enough to combat ſin, it gave them light enough to know and avoid it: But the Chriſtian hath ſo ſevere a Law, that if Love did not ſweeten the ſeverity thereof, it would drive men to deſpair; and, more tragical then Judaiſm, would occaſion not onely prevaricators, but obſtinate and hardned diſciples: For it hath not one Article which is not a Paradox, and which thwarts not the Reaſon as well as the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſinners: The Firſt is, that, to love God aright, we muſt hate our ſelves; and, beſtowing all our affection upon him, reſerve nothing but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred for our ſelves: The ſecond is, to renounce our Will; that is to ſay, to quit all the advantages Nature hath endued us with; not to reaſon in our Myſteries, not to liſten to our Inclinations in the practiſe of Vertues: The Third, which is not leſs rigid, and ſeems to violate the ſweeteſt Laws of Nature, obligeth us to forſake father and mother, and to trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the belly of her that bare us, to follow the voice of him that calls us to his ſervice: But the Fourth, which hath to deal with the deareſt and moſt violent of our Paſſions, commands us to pardon our enemies, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the injuries they have done us, and to ſtifle all thoſe juſt reſentments the love of honour or of life can poſſeſs us with. Who will not pronounce theſe Laws ſo many tortures? theſe Commandments ſo many Purſuivants making inquiſition after our Inclinations into the very inmoſt receſſes of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115672:177"/>our Wils; and one while lopping of love, another while Hatred ſubjects us to as many ſufferings as Martyrs undergo, whoſe arms or legs were chopt off by the cruelty of Tyrants? This made S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſs, that the life of a Chriſtian was a painful Martyrdom,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vita Chriſtiani ſi ſecundum E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat, crux eſt &amp; Martyrium.</hi> Aug.</note> nor that any man could obſerve the Laws of the Goſpel, but muſt condemn himſelf to a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as grievous as that of the Croſs: For this reaſon alſo will I make it appear in this following Diſcourſe, that Chriſtians ſuffer more then the Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe glorious Heroes of the Church ſuffered for the moſt part but in the body; their ſouls were quiet in the midſt of their torments; God hindered the commerce that Nature had placed between theſe two parts whereof we are compoſell; a contented mind inanimated a wretched body, love divorced him from his priſon, and by a kind of prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie diſingaged him from all the painful vexations of his ſlave. In every Chriſtian might be ſeen an Image of Jeſus Chriſt, and as he during his life accorded pleaſure with pain in his perſon, and his glorious ſoul en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened his paſſible and mortal body, this miracle was repeated in favour of the Martyrs, who preſerved their joy in the midſt of their torments: They made Invectives againſt Tyrants, laught at the weakneſſe of their Executioners; and lifting up their ſoul to him that inſpired them with ſtrength, breath'd forth his Panegyrick whiles the flames devoured their bodies, or the wild Beaſts tore them in pieces: But the Chriſtians are bound to make war againſt both bodies and ſouls; to ſtruggle againſt their inclinations and their ſenſes; to exerciſe their juſt indignation againſt theſe two Delinquents, nor to divide thoſe in the correction who were united in the crime.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Martyrs had only grief to maſter; and having tamed this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly enemy were certain of a triumph: But the Chriſtians are engaged to combat pleaſure; and as this pleaſing enemy knows the ſecret of gaining love, it is very hard to ſtand out againſt his charms. Grief is violent, aſtoniſheth thoſe that it ſets upon, quels their courage by the pomp of torments; and he that is aſſiſted with ſtrength, cannot reſiſt the fury of its onſets: In the mean time experience teacheth us, that it is oftner foiled then pleaſure, and that there are more Chriſtians fit to be Martyrs then to be Continent: The ſoul barracadoes it ſelf againſt grief, but lyes open to pleaſure; The will ſtands out againſt the evil that would force her, but gently ſurrenders to the delectation that would corrupt her; her forces are rallied cloſe when ſhe combats grief, but lie ſcattered when oppoſed to ſenſuality: Grief holds no intelligence in the place it ſets upon to facilitate a ſurpriſal, but pleaſure finds a thouſand paſſions that favour her entrance, follow her motions,

                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs, that when God intends to gain a ſoul, or the Devil to ſeduce one, neither of them employ any other thing then
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115672:178"/>pleaſure; and knowing very well that they have to doe with a free crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, make uſe only of allurements to win his conſent without forcing it: God deals only with Grace in the converſion of ſinners, and 'tis by this victorious ſuavity that he gains the Conqueſt, where honour is the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of the Conquerour, and profit the reward of the vanquiſhed: The Devil alſo employs no inſtrument but Pleaſure to corrupt them; he ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies their inclinations, followes their humours, flatters them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and being not ignorant what ſway pleaſure bears over the wil, promiſeth glory to the ambitious, riches to the covetous: or in a word, propoſeth to every ſinner the accompliſhment of all his deſires. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need not wonder if the Chriſtian ſuffer more then the Martyr, becauſe he hath a more redoubted enemy to grapple with, nor can hope for any recompence except he triumph over pleaſure. The great Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath pronounced ſentence in their behalf, and comparing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with Martyrs, hath ſaid, that not to diminiſh the honour theſe have purchaſed by their conſtancy, he did verily believe that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who mortified his body, reſiſted his inclinations, and defended him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from pleaſure, might lawfully pretend to the Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>But if the ſweetneſs that accompanies pleaſure, give Chriſtians ſuch an advantage above Martyrs, we muſt confeſs that the glory which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the Conflict of the later greatly leſſened their ſorrows. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who hath no other conduct then that of Providence, hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that whatever was difficult ſhould withall be glorious;

                        <hi>Quae pulchra difficilia; quae difficilia glorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi> Pla.</note> that glory which is attended with ſo many charms, may give us ſtrength to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the difficulty: ſhe hath ſo well linkt theſe two things together, that they are inſeparable; and wherever ſhe hath planted pain, ſhe hath hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it about with honour. It is a hard matter to perſwade men to change their minds, to calm their paſſions, and to reduce them to their duty; Thus is it glorious to be eloquent, to be acquainted with all the ſecrets Orators make uſe of to conquer without armes, and to gain obedience without violence: 'Tis a buſineſs of much induſtry to rule States, to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern people, to preſcribe laws which may keep them Loyall, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſing their Liberty: 'Tis alſo a high honour to know the myſtery of the Politicks, and to paſs for a great Prince, or a wiſe Stateſman: There is nothing that labours under more difficulties then to tame Nations, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Rebels, force Enemies to ſubmit to the Conditions of Subjects or Allies: Neither indeed is there any thing more illuſtrious then victorious proceedings; and the glory which is but faintly and in part beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Orators and Politians, deſcends unanimouſly and in a full gale upon the head of Conquerors.</p>
                  <p>We ſee nothing in the Church more Noble then Martyrdome; 'tis the higheſt form of Vertue, the laſt expreſſion of Charity, and when a man hath ſhed his bloud, and parted with his life for Jeſus Chriſt, there is
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115672:178"/>not any inſtance can farther be expected from his love: Juſtly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may we acknowledge nothing more auguſt in Religion then Martyrs; They are the Heroes of Chriſtianity, the Gallant men of this State, the Nobleſt parts of this Myſtical Body; there is no greatneſſe that gives not way to their dignity; whatever we admire is below their merit, and according to the opinion of one of the wiſeſt Fathers of the Church,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Plus eſt eſſe Martyrem quam eſſe Apoſtolu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Cyp.</note> 'tis more to be a Martyr then to be an Apoſtle: Neither hath any thing been ever more honoured in the world; Heaven hath wrought a hundred mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to diſcover their innocence; Wild Beaſts have reſpected them; the flames have ſpared their garments; Tyrants have admired them; and many times their Executioners have become their Diſciples; inſomuch that theſe renowned Champions had great reaſon to be afraid of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory at the ſame time that God delivered them from ſorrow: But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians want this conſolation in their Martyrdom; they ſuffer more then they fight; they are Martyrs, becauſe they endure pain to maſter plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; they give proof of their courage, becauſe they reſiſt temptation; but their Martyrdome is ſecret, it paſſeth in ſilence or in ſolitude; they have no witneſſe but their Judge: If the Angels ſurround them, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible; and if they undergo the hardſhips of Martyrs, they have neither their comforts nor their indearments: For as Saint <hi>Auguſtiue</hi> ſaith, the ſoul of a Chriſtian hath inward conflicts and domeſtick enemies; ſhe ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with grief, and expects her crown only from his hands who ſees her thoughts and knows her courage.</p>
                  <p>But the higheſt advantage of the Chriſtian above the Martyr, is, that this mans trial endures but a few days. Nature is ſo good a mother that ſhe hath provided remedies for her children againſt the violent irruption of diſcontents; ſhe hath made the chains that unite the ſoul to the body ſo brittle, that the leaſt torments are able to break them; tortures quickly end, or we end with them; and experience teacheth us, that a puniſhment cannot be long when violent and extream. Criminals muſt be husbanded if you will have them endure; they muſt have reſpite if we intend to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture them for any long time; their weaknes will rid them of their Exeeutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and death ſtepping in to the ſuccour of theſe wretches, delivers them from their perſecutors: Therefore is the puniſhment inflicted upon Martyrs ſhort; many times one day ſaw both its beginning and its end; and when Grace wrought no miracle for their preſervation, Nature uſed her endeavours to ſuccour them: But the Martyrdom of Chriſtians laſts the beſt part of an age; Repentance that afflicts them imitates the Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it makes an agreement between life and death, lengthens that to prolong their miſery, and draws out the thred of their ſorrows to prove them more durably miſerable: For mortification which conſtitutes the chiefeſt exerciſe of penitents, is it not a long and cruell death, which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciplines the body, afflicts the ſpirits, nor gives any intermiſſion to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate Penitentiary, but to heighten his auſterity? This made S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>
                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:115672:179"/>ſay, that the mortification of the fleſh was a kind of puniſhment, not ſo cruel indeed but much more irkſome then that of Martyrs, and recompenſing the ſweetneſſe by the duration, makes the penitent languiſh as long as he lives: But after all theſe differences we muſt confeſſe that the Martyrs having been Chriſtians as well as others, have ſuffered a double puniſhment; and living in penance, were prepared for Martyrdom: For as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves the courſe of their life was a ſevere probation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they diſpoſed themſelves to grief by auſterity, to the priſon by ſolitude, to a ſhort death by a long mortification: Therefore tortures never ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led theſe men who provided for them by a witty cruelty; and in ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an age the Church had no children who were not the Martyrs of Penance when they could not be of Perſecution.</p>

<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115672:179"/>Paſſions are nothing but the motions of love, we may ſay that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are nothing but the Miniſters of Charity. The morality of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is eaſie and ſuccinct; he is not bound to exerciſe himſelf in Patience, to be eſtabliſhed in Juſtice, to be inſtructed in Prudence: Charity gives him an intereſt in all theſe glorious Qualities; and being a Lover, he may boaſt himſelf Couragious, Juſt, Prudent: Aſſoon as he knows how to Love, he is able to guide himſelf; his Light encreaſeth with his Heat; and without conſulting the myſteries of the Politicks, he becomes a Stateſman aſſoon as ever he falls in love with Jeſus Chriſt: As plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures cannot corrupt him, grief cannot aſtoniſh him; His Love inſpires him with Magnanimity and Temperance; and being united to God by Charity, neither the Promiſes, nor the Threats of the world are able to ſeparate him: he is incapable of committing an injuſtice as long as he keeps his affection; and rendring his Soveraign his due, learns at the ſame time to carry himſelf fairly towards his Equals and Inferiours.</p>
                  <p>If Love conſtitute the Chriſtians vertue, it conſtitutes his difference alſo: For as Reaſon diſtinguiſheth Man from Beaſts, makes him equall with the Angels, and in Nature is accounted his principal advantage; we may ſay, that Charity divides the Chriſtian from the ſinner; and being his richeſt ornament, is alſo his nobleſt difference: All the Faithful are clarified with the Light of Faith; they receive in Baptiſm a Character which time cannot deface; they flatter themſelves with a hope which though unjuſt, is notwithſtanding ſometimes true: The Church which comes ſhort of the Knowledge of her Beloved, admits them to the Participation of her Myſteries; and being unable to read their hearts, ſuffers ſacrilegious perſons, becauſe ſhe cannot tell how to hinder them: Nay, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf honours them many times with his choiceſt favours, diſcovers the ſecrets of Futurity to his enemies, gives them an abſolute power in his State, and ſuffers thoſe that offend him to drive away Devils and to cure the ſick: But Charity is the priviledge of his Friends; 'tis the glorious mark diſtinguiſhing them from Reprobates, and the only vertue that is inconſiſtent with ſin: A man may be burnt in the flames, and give teſtimony of his Courage in the midſt of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though he be not at all acceptable to God; a man may dive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Myſteries of Religion, and not be affected with them; may give his goods to the poor, and have his ſoul full of vain-glory: But a man cannot have Charity, and be upon ill terms with Jeſus Chriſt; thoſe that love him are his Beloved; and if he indulge ſome favours to thoſe that fear or ſerve him, he cannot refuſe Heaven to thoſe that die in love with him.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs that Chriſtians, who know that all their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage conſiſts in Charity, make this vertue their principal employment: they deſpiſe not others; for they poſſeſs all in this one: But being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:115672:180"/>it muſt be their felicity in heaven, they make it their buſineſs whilſt they are upon the earth: Theſe Divine Lovers can do nothing but love: they imitate the Seraphims, whoſe Eſſence and Exerciſe is Love; they burn with the ſame Fire that makes them live; they ſwim in flames; and, as if they had forgotten all the vertues to learn one, they ſpend their whole life in this amorous entertainment: If they fear, 'tis to offend him whom their ſoul loveth: if they hope, 'tis to poſſeſs him: if they rejoyce, 'tis for being united to him: if they are afflicted, 'tis for being ſeparated from him: When they have to do with their Neighbour, 'tis upon this wheel that they move: they look onely upon God in his Creatures, and upon Jeſus Chriſt in his Members: if they ſometimes adhere unto them out of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination, Divine Love furniſheth them with wings to ſoar above them, and with ſtrength to be diſentangled from them. Finally, Love ſo well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth the whole courſe of their life, that leaving Reſpect to Domeſticks, Hope to Mercenaries, Fear to Slaves, Light to the Learned, they reſerve onely Charity for themſelves; and are of the humour of that faithful Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, who, being confined to ſolitude, had no other diverſion but her Love.</p>

Greatneſs is ſo oppoſite to Love, that Kings are fain in a manner to depoſe themſelves, when they have a minde to love their Subjects: That Majeſtie wherewith they are encircled, is fitter to ſtrike Fear and Conſternation then Confidence: If they deſcend not from their Throne, lay not by their Crown and Scepter, they can have no Friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Equals: Therefore hath <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved, that Subjects could not contract Alliance with their Soveraigns; that the diſparity of their Conditions permitted not thoſe privacies which maintain Friendſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men; and as long as Kings remain in their Grandeur, Subjects muſt continue in their Reſpect. In the mean time, Charity findes out an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to unite the Chriſtian with God; exalteth the One, without debaſing the Other; equals in ſome ſort their conditions; and, as it obliged God to make himſelf Man, hath given Man a power to make himſelf God.</p>
                  <p>Nor muſt we think it ſtrange that this Vertue is the original of our Happineſs, becauſe it is the ſource of our Merit; and nothing makes us more commendable then Love: Though every thing have its eſtimate in the Church, Order baniſheth Confuſion, and in this vaſt Body every part
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:115672:180"/>hath its priviledge and employments; nevertheleſs the whole perfection conſiſts in Charity: he that knows beſt how to love, is moſt accompliſht; and, without reſpecting his actions or his ſufferings, we conſider onely the meaſure of his Love. The Son of God would not have our merit faſtned to thoſe conditions which depend not upon our ſelves, nor that Greatneſs or Riches ſhould difference his Subjects: He would not place Perfection in Alms, becauſe the Rich onely can diſpenſe them; he would not tye it to Preaching, becauſe that Gift is reſerved for his Miniſters; he would not limit it to Auſterity, becauſe that requires a ſtrong Conſtitution; he would not fix it in Martyrdom, becauſe that depends upon Perſecution, with which the Church is not always afflicted: But he hath eſtabliſhed it in Charity, where nothing is eaſier then this Vertue: The Ignorant and the Learned are equally admitted to it: Kings are not more capable of it then their Subjects: and if Martyrs pretend ſome advantage above the reſt of the Faithful, they have a greater obligation to their Love then to their Torments. The greateſt Saint is not he that hath Suffered moſt, or Done moſt, but he that hath Loved moſt: All his Merit conſiſts in Charity; if occaſions be wanting, he hath recourſe to his deſires; and he may boaſt, that, being a Lover, he is Liberal in Poverty, Learned in Ignorance, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr in the Serenity of converſation.</p>
                  <p>Though all theſe advantages oblige us to Love, that which God wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth to us, is the greateſt endearment of affection: for there are condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Indulgencies, which cannot be found in our Expreſſions; and his love is ſo powerful, and ſo noble, that 'tis eaſie to judge it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed but from an abyſs of Goodneſs: It is Eternal, and before all worlds; God expects not till we ſubſiſt, to ſhew his kindneſs towards us; his love makes inquiſition after us in the confuſed heap of Nothing; as well as his power; he cheriſheth us in what he is pleaſed to put into us; and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating us from all thoſe Creatures which ſhall never ſee the light, makes us the objects of his Liberality: Our Crimes ſtop not the current of his Love; he loves us in our Delinquency; and that which ought to provoke his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh us, provokes his Mercy to deliver us: In Non-entity, he loves Ignorant Creatures; in Sin, he loves ungrateful ones: to the former he gives Being, to the later he gives Grace; and to both of them he makes it appear that his Love is Eternal and Fruitful.</p>
                  <p>Men Love nothing but what is lovely, either really or in ſhew; they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in their friends thoſe qualities they plant not there, and whatever height of greatneſs fortune ſhall advance them to, they can beſtow upon them only riches or honour; if their favorites have any blemiſh in ſoul or body, they cannot mend it; and unhappy in their affections, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained either to hate the man for his imperfection, or to love the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the man: But God, whoſe love is equally powerful and pregnant, makes that amiable which he pleaſeth to ſet his love upon; he himſelf forms his own object; he puts that in his friends which he means to eſteem;
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:115672:181"/>and by a prodigy which ſurpaſſeth all wonder,

                  <p>This Love hath no bounds, neither in relation to its extent nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; 'tis immenſe and infinite both together, and when God loves us, he loves us in all places, and in all his perfections: men are ſo miſerable, that they change manners when they change Countries and Climats; the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments make ſome impreſſion upon their wills; and being no longer what they were, they ceaſe to love what they doated on before: ſhould they be more conſtant, they would be alwayes lyable to this misfortune, that being unable to be but in one place, they could not ſtretch their love every where; they borrow tongues to expreſs their paſſion: Like earthly Kings who being not in a capacity to fill their whole State, are obliged to have Leiutenants which repreſent them; theſe alſo are forc'd to ſeeke out inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters to declare their love, and ſupply their impotency. But Gods Love is immenſe, place confines it not, he loves whereever he is; his charity is as extenſive as his eſſence; in Heaven he cheriſheth the bleſſed, and preſerving his love in all the corners of his State, is affectionate to Chriſtians in the very heart of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>If it be immenſe, 'tis Infinite, and when God loves a perſon, 'tis with the full extent of his perfections: As men are made up of ſoul and body, the faculties of that, and the members of this, have their ſeveral uſes and employments. The Underſtanding conceives thoughts, the Memory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the ſpecies, and onely the will formes acts of Love. The holieſt Lover hath this diſſatisfaction, that he knows he loves God but with one faculty of the ſoul; he is afflicted and not without reaſon, that ſelf-love ſhares with charity, and notwithſtanding all his endeavour, he never loves God as much as he can, or ought to love him. He is not more happy in his body then in his minde; for every member hath its different functions; his hands act according as there is occaſion, his eyes diſcern colours, his ears judge of ſounds, his tongue formes words, and his heart onely is capable of affection: he reproacheth Nature, and complaines that this Step dame having given to him two hands to act, two eyes to ſee, two ears to hear, ſhe hath given him but one heart to love; in the extaſies of his ſoul he wiſheth with <hi>David,</hi> that his whole body were heart and tongue to love and magnifie him with all his power, who is ſo infinitely lovely; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs after all his vain deſires he is obliged to confeſs, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the will in the ſoul, and the heart in his body, which is ſenſible of the endeerments of affection: But inaſmuch as God is a ſimple being, ſuffering neither compoſition nor diviſion; he loves men where ever he is, he hath not any perfection but contributes to the love he bears them: His Juſtice which takes vengeance of his enemies, his Majeſty which makes him reſpected of his ſubjects, his holineſs which ſeparates him from his works, are happily confounded with charity; and as he acts with all his power when he produceth ſome effects, he loves with his whole being when he
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:115672:181"/>expreſſeth his affection to his friends. Therefore the Chriſtians who know very well, that love is paid onely with love, never limit this paſſion; they endeavour to love God with all their power, nor do they wiſh for death but becauſe they are of opinion that delivering them from ſelf-love, they ſhall be perfect lovers in glory.</p>

                  <p>THe advantages we have received from Jeſus Chriſt deliver us not from the misfortunes we drew from <hi>Adam;</hi> our being the children of God frees us not from being his ſlaves; though aſſociated to his Empire, we are ſtill obnoxious to the perſecution of the creature; and though the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his love, feel notwithſtanding the ſeverity of his Juſtice. Thence it comes to paſs that being Pilgrims we are Exiles, and theſe two qualities which claſh in other men, agree exceeding well in Chriſtians: For Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims are honorable, Piety invites them out of their Country, they ſeek Heaven in the Temple they viſit, and honouring the relicks of Saints, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Angels to aſſiſt them in their journeys:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peregrinum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit Pietas, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulem paena; pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrini ſumus qui cives pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum, Exulcs vero quia pecea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores.</hi> Chryſo.</note> But the baniſhed are criminals; Juſtice drives them from their home, ſhe it is that cuts them off from the body of the State like corrupt members, leaſt they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the the reſt: In the mean time Chriſtians are Pilgrims and Exiles; if they draw the former qualities from Grace, they derive the latter fom ſin.</p>
                  <p>To clear this conceit we muſt remember that of all the puniſhments in the world baniſhment is the moſt ſhameful and moſt cruell: It hath ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as a puniſhment for the greateſt crimes, and the moſt notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors have groand under this preſſure. Our firſt father was driven out of Paradiſe after he was condemned to death: That Parricide who ſteep'd his hands in his Brothers blood heard this ſentence pronounced againſt him by the mouth of the Living God, <hi>Eris vagus et profugus ſuper terram;</hi> he deſired that his puniſhment might be commuted, and judging death more gentle them baniſhment; he begged for an end of his life, that he might finde a period of his torment. Therefore is it that <hi>Philo</hi> approving the opinion of <hi>Cain,</hi> ſaid, that death was the end of our evils, baniſhment the beginning; and that if a man going out of the world were worthy of envy, he that departed out of his Country deſerv'd pitty. Thence certainly it comes to paſs, that Chriſtians are dealt with as exiles, that the ſeverity of their chaſtiſement may make them accknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the hainouſneſs of their ſin.</p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:115672:182"/>
                  <p>Indeed thoſe wretches are civilly dead, they have no more commerce with the world, the uſe of the Elements is interdicted them; and if the judges give them leave to live 'tis to make them die more cruelly. Thus it is with man ſince his tranſgreſſion, he hath no more intercourſe with the Angels; he was driven out from Paradiſe; and the Earth being curſed, he muſt water it either with his ſweat or with his tears, if he intend to have it fruitful. Baniſhed perſons poſſeſs nothing; they loſe their ſubſtance in loſing their Country: they can neither make will nor inherite, and they learn to their coſt that want is the inſeparable companion of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: there muſt be ſome edict of the Prince to mitigate the rigour of the ſentence, and without his expreſs permiſſion, their very kindred dare not relive them in their miſery. If Chriſtians be not ſo cruelly dealt with, 'tis from their obligation to the merits of of Jeſus Chriſt: For being ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed they are fallen from all their rights, loſing the ſupreme good they have forfeited all together with him; and what they poſſeſs'd heretofore eſcheating to their ſoveraign by their felony, they can diſpoſe of nothing but by the priviledge they receive from the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Finally, baniſhed perſons are degraded from their nobility; the loſs of their honour is joyned with that of their riches; and being driven from their Native ſoile, they can no longer have any ſhare in the Government or charge of the Common-wealth: There was requiſite an order of the Senate to reſtore <hi>Camillus</hi> to his dignities; neither would he accept of the office of Dictator till recalled from his baniſhment: All men are thus outed ſince the fall of <hi>Adam;</hi> the ſame rebellion that made them poor, made them baſe; they loſt their honour with their innocence; and thoſe that were little lower then the Angels, are reduced to the condition of Beaſts. The world hath put on a new face ever ſince man chang'd their conduct; as long as they were in ſubjection with God, all the creatures were in ſubjection to them; but ſince their inſurrection, all their ſubjects have rebelled; and the Empire where they exerciſed their power, is become the Theater of their puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>This gave <hi>Tertullian</hi> occaſion to compare the world to a priſon, and to make us confeſs that theſe two places ſo different in ſhew were exceeding like really and in deed.

The world in this particular is a perfect image of the Priſon; all ſinners lie fettered in it, their crimes compoſe their chains, and every offence they commit, is a new
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115672:182"/>link making them ſtronger and more weighty: The Priſon is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Delinquents; if an Innocent enter there, 'tis by misfortune; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice built thoſe diſmal habitations for the puniſhment of Criminals; They are Hells upon Earth; the common ſhoars of the ſtate; and, when the Prince hath a mind to rid himſelf of ſome Subject who threatens his Principality with a ſedition or a rebellion, he ſends him to expiate his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in this dreadful dwelling: ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the world hath lodg'd none but ſinners; if you except Jeſus Chriſt and his Mother, all men are guilty; they live and die in this ſhameful condition; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever care Grace takes to render them innocent, there are very few who ſtand not in need of the flames of Purgatory to conſume away what the Calentures of Charity could not. But as in the Priſon the Criminals are always in fear, expecting with a thouſand diſcontents the ſentence of the Judge, trembling leſt being condemned the Officer drag them to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make them in ſome publick place an example to the people; In the world men attend their judgement with the ſame trouble of mind; They are apprehenſive of the leaſt ſickneſs as perſonal ſummons obliging them to appear before the Throne of their Soveraign; they tremble at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very accident that threatens them with a diſſolution; and, redoubting that arreſt which muſt decide the buſineſs of their Eternity,

                  <p>But withall we muſt confeſſe that we are Pilgrims, and if this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eaſe not our pain, it does at leaſt diminiſh our diſhonour: For every one knows, that man was a Pilgrim in the ſtate of Innocence; that he lookt upon Heaven as his Countrey, and though his life were not a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, it was a Pilgrimage. Indeed ſin made it grievous, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the face of the Univerſe, changed our condition with it: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> Paradiſe was a Temple, every creature was an image of God;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Peregrinus erat Adam quia viator, ſed non Exul quia non erat praevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi> Rich. à San. Vic.</note> and though man promiſed himſelf Heaven as the recompence of his merit, he fail'd not to meet with ſome happineſs upon Earth: The place of his Pilgrimage was not yet the path of his Baniſhment; he loved all things without danger, nor feared any change in removing his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and his thoughts daily raiſing him to his Creator, he performed as many acts of Religion, as he employed creatures for his uſe.</p>
                  <p>But now that his condition is changed, and that world for a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his offence hath loſt its reſt and beauty, he is as well as Exile as a Pilgrim, and the place of his Pilgrimage is become that of his Baniſhment, ſo that his whole life muſt be ſpent in deſires and ſorrow; He is neceſſitated to ſigh perpetually after his dear Countrey, to look upon the Earth as a ſtrange place, to diſtruſt all creatures which are in his enemies hands for his deſtruction, and to be like Paſſengers who return home aſſoon
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115672:183"/>as poſſibly they can. Nothing can ſtop theſe when they are ever ſo little affected with thoſe they have left behind; They riſe before the Sun be up, go to their reſt after he is ſet, and by the diligence they make, a man would judge their moſt violent paſſion were to arrive at their beloved Countrey. Thus ought Chriſtians to make ſpeed in the way of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they muſt continually put on, that they may ſhorten their journey, and remember that to be wedded to the Earth, is to prolong their Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p>Pilgrims look upon all objects as indifferent; if they meet with pleaſant ſeats, fruitful fields, populous towns, ſtately buildings, they never loſe the deſire nor the thought of ſpeedily returning into their Countrey; they know very well that ſince they cannot poſſeſſe theſe goodly things, neither ought they to long for them, and that the love they ſpend abroad is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to their engagements at home. Chriſtians inſtructed in the School of the Son of God, have nothing but contempt for the things of the Earth, they behold all its beauties without dwelling upon them, they take heed of pleaſure as their mortalleſt enemy, and they groan ſometimes under the weight of their travels; they confeſs nevertheleſs that the perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world are not ſo tragical as its careſſes.</p>
                  <p>Experience teacheth us, that the pain they endure in it encreaſeth their deſire of reviewing their dear Countrey, and the pleaſure they taſt makes them loſe the remembrance thereof: For 'tis impoſſible ſaith Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> that he ſhould be in love with his Countrey, that doats upon his Baniſhment, or ſhould have any paſſion for Heaven when he is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wedded to the Earth: If he be ſtricken with Divine Love, he ſpends his whole life in ſighs; he never beholds the ſtars but he ſheds tears; and, though there be nothing below that afflicts him, 'tis enough that he is in a ſtrange Land to account himſelf miſerable: His Baniſhment is his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and without inventing other racks to exerciſe his patience, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make him complain that he is condemned to travel. <hi>David</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a profound tranquillity when he ſent up his ſighs towards Heaven, <hi>Heu mihi quia incolat us meus prolongatus eſt:</hi> His ſtate was not divided by a Civil War; the Grandees had not conſpired againſt his perſon; his children had not as yet driven him from his Palace, and the people at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were not cheated with the falſe promiſes of an unlawful Soveraign: In the mean time he forbore not to lament, and the remoteneſs from his Countrey was the ſole cauſe of his tears.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Si amatur pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, magna poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae illium; ſi autem non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matur patria, pejor eſt cordis poena.</hi> Aug.</note> Therefore had S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reaſon to utter theſe gallant words; that to a man that loves his Countrey, Baniſhment is an inſupportable pain; but yet he is more wretched, who cheriſhing his Baniſhment contemns or forgets his Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Finally, Pilgrims ſee nothing during their journey more agreeable then their Countrey; the affection they bear the place of their Nativity, ever defends its cauſe in heir heart; Though it be but a rock environed with precipices, they have ſome ſecret charms which makes them wiſh well to
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115672:183"/>it, and in the midſt of fertile fields, they have a longing for the air they firſt drew their breath in. Chriſtians are in this particular better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded then Pilgrims; For they ſee nothing here below that can equall the beauty of their Countrey; whatever is preſented to their eyes, is but the ſhadow of that happineſs they wait for there: Earth is therefore fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe it receives the influences of Heaven, and all that raviſheth here below, owes its worth to the heat and light of the Sun: Nothing can damage their Countrey, but its greatneſs; their underſtanding is too weak to conceive its Excellency; and, if it be not ſufficiently eſteem'd, 'tis becauſe it is not ſufficiently known. Nevertheleſs 'tis enough to love it to be acquainted, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that it is a bleſſed City, whereof the Angels are the Citizens, the Eternal Father the Temple, the Son the Brightneſs, the Holy Ghoſt the Love; that 'tis a City where men are never born, nor ever die; where perfect Health baniſheth all Sickneſs; where ſatiety expels hunger and thirſt; where reſt admits of no labour; and where we have nothing elſe to doe but to live, reign, and rejoyce eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with God. The Hope of this Happineſs ſweetens our preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and there is not any Pilgrim or Exile upon Earth, who takes not courage when he thinks that after his tedious wanderings, he ſhall enjoy a felicity that nothing can interrupt, nor ever ſhall have an end.</p>

                  <head>The Ninth DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Chriſtian is a Penitent.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IF Baptiſm did waſh away ſelf-love together with ſin, and the Grace we receive in this Sacrament cleared us of ignorance and weakneſs, as well as of malice, we might boaſt, that being innocent, Repentance were uſeleſs: But ſeeing there is no Chriſtian who after his Baptiſm feels not bad inclinations which carry him to ſin, there is none but have need of this vertue, and who after the imitation of the greateſt Saints ought not to joyn the Quality of a Penitent to that of a Sinner: For though light offences rob him not of Grace, he is obliged to be troubled at them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are diſpleaſing to God; and as long as he feels rebellions in his ſoul or in his body, he muſt have recourſe to auſterity to ſtifle them: But if ſin make him loſe the life he received in Baptiſm, Repentance muſt give him a Reſurrection; and coming to the relief of this firſt Sacrament, recover Grace by Sorrow and Contrition.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs, that the Fathers have called Repentance a labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Baptiſm, becauſe the ſinner is waſhed thereby in his tears, and obtains that with much difficulty which was eaſily gain'd in Baptiſm: He is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:115672:184"/>to mingle his bloud with that of Jeſus Chriſt, and to apply the merits thereof by painfull and dolorous works of ſatisfaction: His whole life ought to be ſpent in lamentation;
<note place="margin">Poenitentia eſt Gratia vel virtus qua com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa mala plangimus, &amp; ſemper odimus &amp; iteru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere nolumus.</note> for aſſoon as he ceaſeth to be a Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, he becomes a Sinner: For Repentance, according to the opinion of Divines, is a Grace or a Vertue, whereby, often bewailing our ſins, we always hate them, and conſtantly reſolve never to commit them again. This definition contains four things, which happily expreſs the nature of Repentance; and remarking what it hath common with other vertues, diſcovers alſo what it hath proper and peculiar to it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is called Grace, becauſe it is the gift of God, and finding us in a crime cannot be an effect of our merits: For in that wretched condition we are rather objects of Gods Hatred, then of his Love; and when he delivers, 'tis of his Mercy, and not of his Juſtice: It is alſo called a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, becauſe it fals under the Law, combats ſin, and obtains our pardon: It ſeems to belong to Vindicative Juſtice, becauſe like it it pronounceth ſentences, and invents puniſhments to torture offendors: In a word, it hath no other employment but to prevent the indignation of Heaven, and to oblige it to clemency by its own ſeverity: It enters into the intereſts of God, chaſtiſeth that in time which he would chaſtiſe for Eternity, and endeavours to proportion the correction to the offence of the tranſgreſſor. But though in ſome things it agree with Vindicative Juſtice, in others it is far different: For Juſtice is in the Judge, it pronounceth ſentence from his mouth,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non impunitum erit peccatum meum, ſed ideo nolo ut tu me punius quia ego peccatum meum punias.</hi> Aug. in Pſal. 50.</note> and borrows the hand of the Officer to put it in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Repentance on the contrary is in the offendor, reſides in his ſoul, expreſſeth it ſelf by his mouth, acts by his hands, and contrary to all Natural and Civil Laws, obligeth the Criminal to condemn and puniſh himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice cannot make ſufferings welcome to thoſe that undergo them; though juſt yet are they compulſive, and did not the Judges uſe force in their adminiſtration, all crimes would paſs unpuniſhed: But Repentance by a wonderful dexterity, makes afflictions agreeable, mixeth ſome ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with their ſeverity, and cauſing the guilty perſon voluntarily to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſuch penalties, finds an expedient to make them ſuffer without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring: Finally, Juſtice looks upon the ſin in it ſelf, conſiders only the intereſts of the ſtate, and provided that by puniſhing the wicked ſhe may ſtop the current of Evil, accounts her ſelf ſufficiently happy: But Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance illuminated by the Light of Faith, mounts as high as God, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders his Majeſty offended, and full of zeal and love endeavours to ſatisfie him by puniſhing the ſinner; Thence it comes to paſs that 'tis more ſevere then Juſtice; and, comparing the Excellency of the Creator with the meanneſs of the creature, condemns him to ſufferings which laſt as long as life.</p>
                  <p>When ſtrength fails, it hath recourſe to tears, and gives it ſelf over to ſighs to expiate the offences committed. Morality hath obſerved, that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115672:184"/>tears ſerve us in all our paſſions: Joy hath its tears as well as Grief, and when exceſſive, hath a ſpice of groaning: Love cannot avoid them; when the heart is wounded, it bleeds at the eyes; and that Lover had reaſon to blame the Stoicks, who allowed their Scholars to love, but by no means to weep. Mercy is never without Tears, it daily lets fall ſome drops as witneſſes of her compaſſion: When ſhe cannot relieve the diſtreſſed,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lacrymis alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ſudant, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca ſuperſtitio.</hi> Stat.</note> ſhe bewails them; and this remedy is ſo common, that when the Pagans made a Goddeſs of this vertue, the Victims they offered were Tears and Sighs: But if there be any paſſion which profitably makes uſe of them, we muſt confeſs it to be Sorrow; this affection is better expreſſed by weeping then ſpeaking; her Tears are more eloquent then her Words, and ſhe gains more victories by her groans then by her reaſons. Thence it comes to paſs that Repentance being nothing elſe but a Sorrow for ſin, it ſwims continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in tears, interrupts its prayers with ſobbings,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Purgatorium a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae, Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Poenitentiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, diluvium pecca. torum.</hi> Hiero. Chryſ. Greg.</note> and mingles bloud with tears in all its ſacrifices: Therefore do the Fathers of the Church call it ſometimes the Purgatory of the ſouls, ſometimes the Deluge of ſins, ſometimes the Baptiſm of ſinners, and ſometimes the Bath of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon all thoſe that have gone about to appeaſe the Juſtice of God, have had recourſe to their Tears: <hi>David</hi> mingled them with his drink, and that famous Penitent watered his Couch with them in the night ſeaſon: <hi>Mary Magdaleu</hi> obtain'd pardon for her ſins by that innocent Stratagem, ſhe bedewed the feet of her Maſter with her tears, wip'd them with the hair of her head, and making that inſtrumental to her Repentance which had been to her Vanity, deſerved the glorious name of the Beloved of Chriſt: But he himſelf whom we may ſtyle a publick Penitent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail'd our ſins to expiate them, he mingled his ſighs with his words up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, and for the conſummating of his ſacrifice, he was pleaſed that the Victim ſhould be bathed in his bloud and in his tears. In the mean time all ſinners deſpiſe this condition of Repentance, they bewail their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, but never weep for their tranſgreſſions; and knowing not well how to apply this remedy, vainly ſigh for the loſs of their honour or their goods, but are never ſeriouſly ſad for the loſs of Grace. Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> blames himſelf in his Confeſſions, that he lamented the death of <hi>Dido,</hi> but wept not over the death of his ſoul; that he beſtowed ſome tears upon a woman that loved a man too much, and denyed them to a ſinner that was deficient in his affection to his God.</p>
                  <p>Though Tears make up one part of Repentance, they may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wiped away; theſe fountains dry up with time, and there are few ſinners who like Saint <hi>Peter</hi> can bedew their cheeks as often as they call to mind their offences: But they ought always to abominate them, and if there be ſome truce with their tears, their hatred muſt have no intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The vertues are not always active; inaſmuch as they have none but particular enemies, they take their reſt when they have either defeated
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:115672:185"/>or worſted them: Continence lays aſide her arms when ſhe hath mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Body; Humility takes ſome reſpite when the ſpirit is tam'd; and Patience is ſatisfied when ſhe hath calm'd the motions of anger: But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is a publick vertue; whether ſhe make war upon all kinds of ſins, revenge the outrages done againſt God, ſet upon his enemies, ſhe is never at reſt: Her employment is continuall; and as long as ſhe ſees any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of pride or impurity in the ſoul or body, ſhe ſpends all her pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſtifle them.</p>
                  <p>The havock that ſin bath made in our nature, maintains her in this humour; ſhe cannot away with our irregularities, at ſight of them ſhe preſently meditates vengeance; and as often as ſhe conſiders our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkned, and our will depraved, ſhe reſents a juſt indignation which awakens her againſt the ſin. Nothing ſo much incenſeth a Prince againſt an enemy that hath waſted his ſtate, as when purſuing him with his Troops he ſees the Fields deſolate, the Towns beaten to the ground, the Villages burnt to aſhes, and which way ſoever he turns himſelf meets with the marks of the fury of a ſtranger: Neither does any thing ſo much ſet an edge upon Repentance, as when bidding ſin battle, ſhe beholds the diſorders it hath wrought in ſinners, and perceives neither parts in their body nor faculties in their ſoul which are not out of order: Her juſt anger reacheth ſometimes over the very men, and finding they have taken this Tyrants part, ſhe animates them againſt themſelves, and making them ſerviceable to her indignation, changeth their love into hatred, and their pleaſures into puniſhments.</p>
                  <p>Indeed every Penitent is his own Judge; he enters into the intereſts of God; and as if he were elevated above himſelf, he conceives he hath ſome right to revenge the former and puniſh the later. Anger according to the opinion of Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is nothing elſe but a deſire of vengeance; and vengeance according to the ſenſe of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> is only the fruit or effect of anger: But inaſmuch as this paſſion is extreamly violent, and that it is a hard matter to keep a juſt meaſure when we are Arbitrators in our own cauſe: God was willing to reſerve the diſpoſal thereof to himſelf: He it is that revengeth the Innocents, and puniſheth the Guilty; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many things that belong to him, there is none that he is ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of as this; <hi>Mihi vindictam &amp; ego retribuam:</hi> If he give ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons leave to make uſe of this right, 'tis after he hath made them his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and of ſo many men that people the world, there are none but Kings and Parents that have a power to correct their ſubjects or their children: But as the Penitent holds the place of God here below, and takes part in his Intereſts, he ſhares alſo in his Juſtice and Power; he pronounceth ſentence againſt himſelf, condemns himſelf as a Judge, puniſheth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an Executioner, and being not able to endure himſelf, diſchargeth his fury upon all the parts of his body. He imitates thoſe that are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with anger; and as they find no vengeance that can ſatisfie them,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115672:185"/>nor any puniſhments that equal their injuries, no more can he any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings that content him, nor any chaſtiſements that equall his offences.</p>
                  <p>From anger he paſſeth to hatred, and fully to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, handles himſelf as a Criminal or as an Enemy; he exerciſeth acts of Hoſtility againſt his body; and finding nothing more ignominious, nor more cruell then the Croſs, condemns himſelf unto it, and willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth it: For Saint <hi>Auguſtin</hi> teacheth us, that the true Penitent ought to be crucified while he lives; that the Counſels and Precepts of Chriſt are the nails that muſt pierce his heart; that every inclination is a foot or a hand that he is bound to faſten to the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt; and that it is a crime to take out the nails as long as we live upon the Earth. The Great Saint <hi>Leo</hi> is of this mind, and though he were of ſo mild a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he is ſo ſevere in this point, that he cannot judge us worthy to be the Members of the Son of God, if our fleſh be not crucified with his: He will not have us the ſame after Repentance that we were before; but out of a ſeverity which he believes founded upon the Sacrament of our Reconciliation, he will have us put off the old man and put on the new, and renouncing all pleaſure, make our body become the Image of Chriſt crucified.</p>
                  <p>When he is arrived to this degree of ſeverity, he hath no more to do but perſevere that he may become worthy of the glorious name of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: For the ſorrow is not true, unleſs it be conſtant; the Repentance is not ſincere, unleſs it be faithful; and he is rather a Deceiver then a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, who having teſtified ſome deſire of amendment of life, commits with pleaſure the offence he had bewailed with grief. Many, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> proteſt that they are ſinners, and continue ſtill to ſin; This acknowledgment is indeed a Conſeſſion, but no Correction;

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is hard to determine,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non minus ſe debere Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teli quam Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo dicebat Alexander.</hi> Plut.</note> Whether we have more obligations to our Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or to our Fathers: for if the one faſhions our Body, the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions our Minde; if the one give us Life, the other gives us Reaſon; and if we receive from the one our Riches, from the other we receive our Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Therefore in all Antiquity Diſciples bore the name of their Maſters as well as of their Fathers; nor were they leſs jealous of the Learning of thoſe that had inſtructed them, then of the glory of theſe that had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them. This difference hath no place among Chriſtians; Becauſe, he that gives them Life, gives them Grace; and the ſame Jeſus Chriſt that hath conceived them in his Wounds, hath taught them in his School: He is the Father and the Maſter of the Faithful; and as theſe two Qualities oblige us to bear his Name, they oblige us alſo to relinquiſh our own.</p>
                  <p>He is jealous of this honour; and whatever part his Miniſters take in his advantages, he hath never been willing to let them ſhare in this. The Apoſtles never transferred their name to their diſciples; theſe faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants wrought all their gain for their Maſter; knowing very well that all their power was derived from him, they laboured onely for his glory; and when they had brought forth children, they named them by the name of Jeſus Chriſt, and not their own. They imitated, ſaith S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> the Iſraelites, who, marrying the widow of their brother, made their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren bear the name of the dead. Jeſus Chriſt died upon the Croſs; his Miniſters are his Brethren; and, to accompliſh his deſigne, they beget children for him by preaching: but they owe him ſo much reſpect, that they baptize them in his Name, and call them Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as this advantage is great, it carries great obligations along with it; and all the Faithful are bound to imitate the Son of God: This honourable Title exacts this duty from them. 'Tis in vain, ſaith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>

It is lawful for Infidels, that know not the true God, to ſeek for Patterns among men, becauſe they can finde none among the gods; and they may regulate their actions according to the example of the <hi>Socrates</hi>'s or <hi>Cato</hi>'s: But 'tis a crime for a Chriſtian to tranſcribe any other copie then that of Jeſus Chriſt: He that hath formed them, ought to guide them; and as his Death is their Glory, his Life muſt be their Morality.</p>

But neither are the Saints themſelves to be our Models any further then they are conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Jeſus Chriſt.

Thence it came to paſs that the Primitive Chriſtians, that had no other Morality then the Life of the Son of God, diſtributed their goods to the Poor when they entered into the Church; and were of opinion that it was to doubt of the Maximes of their Maſter, not to follow his Examples.</p>
                  <p>Though Piety be now grown cold, we have ſtill light enough to know that the Chriſtian is obliged to contemn Preſent things, and to hope for Future: He hath not embraced Religion, to finde his acquieſcence in this world: He is no ſooner admitted into the School of Chriſt, but he learns that the earth
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115672:187"/>is his Baniſhment, and heaven his Country; nor that he is to make any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of periſhable goods, further then they may conduce to the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eternal; he uſeth his Riches to purchaſe the glory of heaven, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures perſecutions as Trials, embraceth poverty as an Advantage, grief as an Exerciſe, faſting as a Remedy; and ſetting no eſtimate upon things but as they relate to his end, accounts thoſe moſt beneficial which take him off from the world, and fix him upon Jeſus Chriſt. The true Chriſtian, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> never need trouble himſelf to grow rich; if his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors have left him any poſſeſſions, he ought to account them falſe, that he may long after true ones, and that the contempt he hath of Thoſe, may raiſe the opinion he hath of Theſe: For 'tis a certain Maxime, as the ſame Saint goes on, that the man that loves Earthly goods, hath but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle minde towards thoſe of Heaven; and that he that is beſotted with the delights of the preſent world, never dreams of the pleaſures of the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the Chriſtian is not Regenerated in the Church, to ſeek for his happineſs upon Earth; he makes no reckoning of what the Wicked poſſeſs; and he perceives that Riches and Honours are not the rewards of the Juſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non ad hoc ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Chriſtiani, ut terrenam no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis felicitatem quaetamus, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> plerumque ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent latrones &amp; ſcelerati.</hi> Aug.</note> becauſe God beſtows them upon his enemies: He ſuffers Infidels to raign, to inſtruct his Diſciples; he abandons the faireſt part of the world to them that perſecute him, to teach us that Heaven is our Patrimony: and as he puniſheth not all Crimes here belowe, neither doth he recompenſe all Vertues, to perſwade us that there is another life where Miſery and Happineſs are real. Therefore is it that all the Faithful finde not here matter of Joy and Rejoycing; they uſe tranſitory things with ſo much diſcretion, that they no way prejudice thoſe Eternal ones they look for; and believing themſelves Pilgrims upon earth, are afraid to meet with ſome Charm, which, making this Exile too agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, may occaſion them to loſe the remembrance of their dear Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>As the Chriſtian ought to contemn Pleaſures, ſo is it his part to prize Sorrow, and to remember that his two Births, though never ſo different, oblige him equally to ſuffer. The Firſt expoſeth him to the perſecution of the Creatures, to the unfaithfulneſs of the Senſes, to the revolt of the Paſſions; and becauſe Criminal, engageth him in Miſery and Suffering, Man is born of a woman,

                  <p>His Second birth obligeth him to Sorrow: Jeſus Chriſt gave him life upon the Croſs, the Church conceived him in Perſecution; and his father
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115672:187"/>and mother joyntly engage him in the Combat: he is no Chriſtian, if he do not ſuffer; he is unworthy of ſo fair a name, if he be not afflicted; nor does he yet believe, if in the midſt of his reſt he reſent no diſpleaſures: For, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith excellently well, if he be truely faithful, he muſt be zealous for the glory of Jeſus Chriſt: he cannot ſee his Perſon diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, or his Commandments violated, but he is grieved at it. Bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples trouble him, the Kingdom of Satan torments him, the impiety of his Miniſters vexeth him; and when he hath none of theſe rude trials, his being yet at a diſtance from heaven, is enough to make him account himſelf miſerable. In the mean time, he hath no other felicity but pain; though he groan, he knows that Delights are more tragical then Diſcontents: he is glad of perſecution, and ſtorming his ſpirit, changeth his complaint into grateful acknowledgements, becauſe he is perſwaded that Vertue is not preſerved but by infirmities. For his comfort, he many times enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains himſelf with this Maxime, he labours to eſtabliſh himſelf in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this Paradox, and bleſſeth afflictions, becauſe, if juſt, they increaſe his Merit; if guilty, ſerve for his Correction.</p>

If his Diſciples imitate him not, if they fear Afflictions, ſeek after Pleaſures, value Riches, deſpiſe Poverty, we muſt conclude with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> either that they are not Chriſtians, or but bad ones. For, as that incomparable Doctor ſaith, there are many that bear the name of Believers, and have neither their Faith nor their Vertue: they wrong the Sacraments of the Church, diſhonour the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, do deſpight to his Croſs, condemn his Example; and being unwilling to regulate their lives according to his, make it appear he is not their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor they his Diſciples: Theſe wretches ſeek nothing but their Intereſts; living in themſelves, they die to Jeſus Chriſt; and for the higheſt pitch of misfortune, deſtroy others in loſing themſelves. Their Evils become contagious; they corrupt thoſe that come neer them; and fighting againſt the deſignes of the Son of God, engage them in ſin that he would deliver from thence: They encroach upon the moſt eminent of his qualities; and propounding themſelves for examples to the Faithful, ſtrive to ſpread their impiety over the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>Let us defend our ſelves from their Infection; and ſeeing we have no other Pattern then Jeſus Chriſt, let us try to regulate our life accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his: Let us imitate his Actions, becauſe they are holy; reverence his Maximes, becauſe true: and that we may be the Copies of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115672:188"/>Original, let us eſteem thoſe things he eſteemed, and deſpiſe thoſe things he deſpiſed: Let us be poor, becauſe he was born in a Stable, and died upon a Croſs: let us not fear Hunger, becauſe he ſuffered it in the deſarts; not tremble at Nakedneſs, becauſe he had but one gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that the Executioners robbed him of when they nailed him to the Croſs: Let us not be afraid of Perſecutions, becauſe he underwent ſo many during his life; nor let Death terrifie us, becauſe that which he choſe was as cruel as ignominious: if we himitate him upon Earth, we ſhall be like him in heaven; if we ſuffer with him, we ſhall raign with him; and if we ſhare in his diſgraces in Time, we ſhall partake of his glory in Eternity.</p>

Ask all people, whoſe deſigns are more different then their faces, we ſhall find they all conſpire together in the ſearch of felicity. They may peradventure propound ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ideas thereof, but their deſire is one and the ſame; neither are there
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115672:189"/>any wretches ſo miſerable, who have not a mind to be happy: All con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the world agree in this point, and their differences are ſo many paths, whereby men reſolve to arrive at the ſame end. The Covetous ſeek felicity in treaſures; and as if nature had taught them that plenty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends this ſtate, they never pretend to enrich themſelves, but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may become happy.</p>
                  <p>Conquerours ſeek their felicity in victory; and, becauſe nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts man in Beatitude, their aim is in ſubduing their enemies to ſubject all things to their power. The Learned are in love with ſcience for no other end, but becauſe they are perſwaded that felicity conſiſts in the knowledge of the ſupream Verity, and of all others by that light. The Ambitious are paſſionate for honour, becauſe they have learnt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is an Eternal Glory; neither are they to be blamed, becauſe they are deſirous of honour, but for that they ſeek it where they neither can nor ought to find it.

Thence it comes to paſs, that they ſpend themſelves in deſires, form new projects; and never content with what they poſſeſs, heap Conqueſts upon Conqueſts if ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; Treaſures upon Treaſures if covetous; Novelty upon Novelty if Curious: Their deſires are not unjuſt, becauſe without bounds, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without prudence; I condemn them not becauſe they are inſatiable, but becauſe they are blind, and fix upon objects which entertain their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence and Conſumption.</p>
                  <p>Every one blames <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, becauſe he could not bound his Conqueſts; that he paſſed from kingdome to kingdome; that the Earth ſeem'd too ſcant for his ambition; and what contented ſo many Kings could not ſatisfie him: But for my own part, I think Divine Providence had a mind to let us ſee in this Conquerour that there is nothing in the world that can ſatiate the deſires of man, that all the Scepters of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe have not charms enough to make him happy, and that his heart lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then all Empires, can be filled only with God: Indeed inaſmuch as God is his Creator, he ought to be his felicity; as he is the Principle of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115672:189"/>his Being, he muſt be the object of his Content; and, having given him life by his power, muſt give him Beatitude by his Goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is a queſtion in Divinity, whether man being a reaſonable creature can have any other end then his Creator; and whether the Angels who are his ſuperiours in Nature and in Grace, can be the objects of his felicity: But not to engage in the deciſion of a thing which depends abſolutely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the will of God, I may ſafely anſwer with Saint <hi>Auguſtine:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>In rebus à Deo factis tam ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnum bonum eſt natura ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis, ut nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum fit bonum quo beata ſit niſi Deus.</hi> Aug. de Nat. bon. cap. 7.</note> That man in the ſtate he is now in, can have no other end but God. He is too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſaith that great Doctor, to find his felicity in a creature; he is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the ſupream good, hath inclinations towards it which cannot be blotted out; He would be wretched, had he not ſome hope of poſſeſſing it; his deſires would become his torment, were he not aſſured there was a poſſibility of ſatisfying them; and whatever ſhould be offered him in exchange of the good they would deprive him of, would miniſter nothing but want and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>But if this were an injuſtice to man, it would be an injury to God: For he hath two qualities whereof he is equally jealous; The firſt is that of Creator, which he communicates to none; He cals neither Men nor Angels to his aid, when he creates any thing; the diſtance of Entity from Non-Entity is ſo great, that it cannot be ſurmounted but by an infinite power, and the creature is too weak to be raiſed to ſo high a degree. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> believes 'tis to violate the reſpect due to God to imagine that the Angels can become Creators; and God himſelf who makes uſe of the Sun to preſerve his works, would not make uſe of it to create them, leſt men ſhould aſcribe an honour to it, which he reſerves for himſelf.
<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> Indeed we obſerve in Scripture, that the fruits and flowers, the trees and plants, which owe their preſervation to the beauties of the Sun, were created two days before this glorious Luminary; that all nature might learn that if it were their Preſerver, it never was their Creator.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Quality which God by no means communicates, is, that of the laſt end: He is ſo jealous, that he will not have us ſtay at the creature; 'tis a fault in our Religion to be in love with them: Our love that it may be innocent, muſt aim directly at God; and whatever action a Chriſtian does, he ſins if he propounds himſelf any other end then his Principle. All the ſins of the world are derived from this diſorder; men become not Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, but becauſe they cloſe with the creature, and of means deſigned them by God to arrive unto him, make their laſt end, and their ſupream felicity.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe or occaſion of this Errour comes from this, that the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of God are ſhed abroad in his creatures: For he delineates himſelf in them when they are produced, and hath been pleaſed to make them his Pourtraitures or his Images. The Sun is an effuſion of his Light; The Heaven which encloſeth the Univerſe is an image of Immenſity; The Earth which is centred upon its own weight, repreſents us his Conſtancy;
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:115672:190"/>the fields laden with fruits and adorned with flowers, are the marks of his beauty; and all the perfections that are diſperſed in the ſeveral works of his hands, are the rivulets of this Ocean, or the rayes of this Sun. Thence it comes to paſs, that ſinners preſerving in the root of their inclinations an appetite for the ſupream good, faſten upon every thing that repreſents it; and preferring the Copies before the Original, court the creature, and keep at diſtance from the Creator.</p>
                  <p>But if their blindneſs make them wander, their miſery reclaims them, and they learn by woful experience that God only can cure them of their maladies. Mans deſires ariſe either from his weakneſs or from his want; he covets what he ſtands in need of, nor hath he ever recourſe to wiſhes, but when the things that he hath a mind to are out of his power. Both theſe appetites cannot be ſatisfied with the poſſeſſion of the Creature: If the beauty that ſparkles upon a face pleaſe our eyes, it cannot charm our ears; if riches protect us from poverty, they cannot ſecure us from grief; if glory have a powet to draw an ambitious man out of infamy or contempt, it cannot deliver him from obloquy or envy; and if Crowns and Scepters exempt Kings from ſervitude, they cannot guard them from death: Thus in whatever condition men find themſelves, they are obliged to aſcend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the creatures, to ſeek for him, who being the Fountain of all good, is alſo the remedy againſt all evil; and with <hi>David</hi> to beg of him their cure and deliverance, <hi>De neceſſitatibus meis erue me.</hi>
                  </p>

The ſight of his Divine Eſſence ſatisfies all their wants, remedies all their evils, and contents all their deſires; the belief they have by faith, the expectation they conceive by hope, begins their felicity here below: It is true that as the ſupream Good cannot be fully known upon Earth, neither can happineſs be perfect here; and being never entirely poſſeſt in the region of mortality, there are always miſeries to be undergone and languiſhings to be endured.</p>

                  <p>HE was not much miſtaken, who conſidering that the Earth ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven and Hel, ſaid, it held ſomething of both theſe extreams: Indeed Pleaſure is here mixt with Grief, Light confounded with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Plenty attended with Want, and men are happy and miſerable both together. But certainly we muſt confeſs, that ſince the Earth was curſed for the ſin of man, it partakes more of the qualities of Hel then of Heaven: For beſides that all things here are in a confuſion; that the ſeaſons are irregular; that the Elements bid us battail; that the wild Beaſts either perſecute us or deſpiſe us; it is certain that Felicity is not to be met with here below, and that man is exceedingly more miſerable then happy.</p>
                  <p>All the world confeſſeth that Beatitude conſiſts in the knowledge of the Supream Good, and that no man can be truly content who is not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this prime Verity from whence all the reſt flow as from their Fountain. Profane Philoſophy ſays the ſame concerning this Maxim, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſhe any Maſters or Scholars, who make not this confeſſion, that as the mind is more noble then the body, 'tis in the operations of that, not in the ſenſes of this that Beatitude is to be ſought for. In the mean time Earth is the habitation of obſcurity; we know God but in an Enigma; we have only doubts and conjectures of his Greatneſs; and though we are fully perſwaded of his Exiſtence, we are altogether ignorant of his Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>If we conſult our ſenſes, they cannot inform us of his Divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and having neither ſhape nor colour, our eyes nor our ears cannot tell us notice of him. If our ſpirit reflect upon it ſelf, and elicite ſome act to know its Author in knowing it ſelf, it findes that the images it produceth are but Idols or phantaſms, and that the apprehenſions it conceives of him are only miſtakes and falſhoods. If Faith ſtep in to the relief of the Underſtanding, and obliging it to renounce its proper light, clarifie it with what ſhe brings, 'tis with ſo much obſcurity that it hath more merit then ſatisfaction in its obedience. I know very well that this vertue raiſeth man, abſtracts him from ſenſe, gives him admittance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the light of God himſelf, neither can he complain that reaſoning is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed him being prepared for an Intelligence: But certainly ſhe pays him theſe advantages with uſury: For he believes without knowing, gives his ſenſes the lye, condemns his reaſon, and obligeth himſelf to die for thoſe
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115672:191"/>truths he cannot yet underſtand. Thus man is never happy in this world, and whatever certainty he have of the myſteries of our Religion, he will never attain to an evidence of them.</p>
                  <p>From this misfortune there arrives a ſecond, which is no whit leſs conſiderable; For inaſmuch as the Underſtanding is the Gandle of the ſoul which enlightens the will,

There is ſomething always wanting to her love, and to her happineſs; her poſſeſſion is continually imperfect, nor are her deſires ever without diſcontent: whatever taſt ſhe hath of felicity, it rather ſets an edge upon her love then any way appeaſeth it; and whatever pleaſure ſhe finds in tranſitory and periſhable goods, ſhe feels by experience they may poſſibly divert her, but no ways content her: Their ſcantneſs cauſeth her indigence; ſhe continually changeth objects, ſtriving to find that in one which ſhe cannot meet with in another; ſhe is like the Bees who ſip upon all flowers to taſt the dew that drops from heaven; and being wearied with the various turnings and windings of the world, is obliged to confeſs that Beatitude is found no where but in God, but he is neither met with, nor enjoyed upon Earth.</p>
                  <p>I proceed, and ſay, that ſhould he ſuffer himſelf to be ſeen by his creature in the condition whereto ſin hath reduced him, it would prove rather a ground of fear and aſtoniſhment, then of love and ſatisfaction. There is ſo little proportion between God and Man, that the one muſt needs be abaſed, or the other greatly exalted, that there may be ſome commerce between them: The Majeſty of God muſt be clouded by ſome allay of condeſcenſion, and mans weakneſs ſtrongly heightned by ſome gracious endowment; or certainly, the preſence of God which is the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Angels in Heaven, would occaſion the miſery of man upon Earth. The Scripture tells us, we cannot ſee him and live, his aſpect is formidable, his ſplendour dazles our eyes, his greatneſs chides our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, neither can we behold this Sun but we are in danger of loſing our life together with our ſight. The righteous in the Old Teſtament repent their ſeeing him, and though he temper his Majeſty to accommodate it to our weakneſs, they conceive this favour muſt be followed with their death: <hi>Deum vidimus, moriemur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſhould his Almightineſs be proportionable to our miſery, and this Divine Sun like that of the Poets,

Fear more afflicts us then the enjoyment can delight us; we reſent miſery in the midſt of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and we finde our happineſs of the nature of thoſe colours of the Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon, that periſh with the object that produceth them. So then, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:115672:191"/>durable in the world; the nobleſt creatures are all ſubject to change; whatever is poſſeſt, may be loſt: The Soul, though Immortal, is not Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; ſhe that cannot die, can ſin: and though Grace be an emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Glory, it hath neither its conſtancy nor duration: it is a kinde of Miracle that God works in favour of his Elect,

And this is the laſt Reaſon I intend to make uſe of, to let you ſee that the Earth is not the habitation of the Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe that form any Idea of Happineſs, acknowledge that as it comprehends all Good, it ought to exclude all Evil: did it not include all of one ſort, it would not be perfect; and did it not expel all of the other, it would be miſerable. In the mean time, the Earth is the region of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: Goods are very ſcarce, but Evils come in crowds: He that poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Riches, languiſheth after Honour; he that raigns in a Kingdom, does not always bear rule in his Perſon; and if he triumph over his Enemies, he ſeldom triumphs over his Paſſions: He that bathes himſelf in Pleaſures, is drowned many times in Sin; and he that is upon good terms with For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is for the moſt part at oddes with Himſelf. Thus all men are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe they are indigent; nor does the condition of their preſent life ſuffer them to aſſociate all good things together, to compoſe a perfect felicity.</p>
                  <p>It happens alſo, by a neceſſary conſequence, that there are a thouſand Evils from which they cannot defend themſelves: Their ſouls and their bodies are equally diſpoſed to grief: theſe two Delinquents, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake not one another in the Sin, ſhare in the Puniſhment; and Earth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Hell, torments them both for company. The Body bears an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the bowels of it that devours it; the natural heat that inanimates it, conſumes it: This wretched mother brings forth two Maladies, which, though natural, are notwithſtanding mortal, if there be not ſome ſpeedy remedies applied: For Hunger and Thirſt are puniſhments that cannot be avoided; theſe two executioners harraſe all the children of <hi>Adam:</hi> and when the Son of God was incarnate, he ſuffered their aſſaults: he was hungry in the deſarts, thirſty in <hi>Samaria;</hi> and the blood which the ſtripes and nails drew from his veins, made him utter that word upon the Croſs which expreſt his Thirſt as well as his Love, <hi>Sitio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The evils which ariſe from our Conſtitution, are accompanied with others that ariſe from the confuſion of the Univerſe: Heat and Cold per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute us, Summer and Winter bid us battel; the Seaſons grow irregular to make us ſuffer, and the Elements jar to deſtroy us: Our State is nothing now but a Country of enemies or ſtrangers; our Subjects either know us not, or contemn us; and this place, which was heretofore the Threatre of our Glory, is now the Scaffold of our Puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as the Soul is more culpable then the Body, ſhe is alſo more
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:115672:192"/>miſerable;
<note place="margin">

The Firſt is the revolt of the Paſſions, which always diſturb her reſt: Love and Hatred appear without her leave; the firſt gets up by deſires, and hopes to be joyned to the object that gives it birth: If he meet with any oppoſition to his deſignes, he makes uſe of Anger and Boldneſs to maſter it; if he be victorious, he triumphs with Joy; if defeated, he falls into deſpair, and is wholly given over to grief. Hatred imitates Love; ſhe calls in the Paſſions to her aid that hold of her Empire; and having diſcovered her enemy, removes for fear, if too weak, or ſets upon him with anger, if ſhe conceive her ſelf ſtrong enough: When her enterpriſe ſucceeds well, ſhe triumphs as well as Love; and when her endeavours are fruſtrated, ſhe alſo ſinks into deſpair and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But that which is moſt troubleſom in all theſe diſorders, is, that they rebel in ſpite of Reaſon, and the ſoul is forced to ſuffer theſe inſurrections which ſhe cannot help.</p>
                  <p>The Second miſery ſhe is ſenſible of, is the irregularity of her actions: though ſhe conſult with Prudence and Juſtice, though ſhe keep a medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity which conſtitutes Vertue, ſhe ſteps aſide many times from her duty, and, under ſpecious pretences, falls into vitious extremes: Sometimes ſhe is too indulgent, or too ſevere in puniſhing: ſometimes ſhe is too reſerved, or too laviſh in her preſents; ſometimes ſhe is too cowardly, or too hardy in her combats:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Non eſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctanda ſinceritas veritatis à ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibus corporis: nihil eſt enim ſenſibile, quod non habeat fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile falſo.</hi> Aug.</note> ſo that many times it falls out ſhe commits a Crime, when ſhe thinks to practiſe a Vertue.</p>
                  <p>The Third miſery which ſhe can hardly avoid, is, Errour and Illuſion: For being a priſoner in the Body, ſeeing nothing but through the Senſes, and ſo compelled to make uſe of theſe unfaithful meſſengers, ſhe is oftner engaged in a lye then in truth; and is ſo badly informed of what ſhe ought to love or hate, that for the moſt part ſhe confounds Good with Evil, Vice with Vertue.</p>
                  <p>But the Fourth miſery, inſeparable from her condition, and contrary to her felicity, is, the weakneſs ſhe reſents in all her enterpriſes: if ſhe think to conquer Temptations, ſhe ſinks under them; if ſhe thinks to mount up to heaven by holy contemplations, her body like a clog weighs her down to the earth; if ſhe ſtrive to combat her Inclinations, ſhe findes her Senſes favouring their party, and that ſhe hath as many Enemies as ſhe believes her ſelf to have Subjects. In the midſt of ſo many miſeries, ſhe hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one conſolation, that Grace is ſufficient to make her victorious: <hi>Sufficit tibi gratia mea:</hi> But theſe words that comfort her, teach her that the earth is not the manſion of Happineſs, becauſe it is the Pitched Field where we muſt win the Victory to deſerve the Triumph.</p>

                  <head>The Third DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Chriſtian tastes ſome Happineſs here belowe.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THough the earth be not the habitation of reſt, and all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> are condemned to labour ſince the ſin of their father; yet fail they not to taſte ſome Pleaſure among their Sorrows. The Divine Juſtice tempers its Chaſtiſements with ſome Graces; Mercy ſteps to the relief of theſe wretches; and the merits of Jeſus Chriſt obtain favours for them, which are not onely the Pledges, but the Antepaſts of Felicity: Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is mixt with Hope in our ſouls; the ſame advantages that make us hope for Glory, give us a title to poſſeſs it; and the Vertues which make us Saints, render us in ſome ſort Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Faith is the firſt vertue that unites us to Jeſus Chriſt; ſhe that initiates us into his Myſteries, that enrols us of his Family, makes us the Subjects of his State, and the Members of his Myſtical Body: It clarifies our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, in ſubjecting it; imparts ſome Flames together with its Lights that warm our Will, and gain our conſent to the belief of thoſe Verities that ſurpaſs our apprehenſion. But its principal and moſt wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is, to make Jeſus Chriſt preſent in our ſouls, and to give us a taſte here belowe of the felicity of Angels: for theſe Spirits are therefore hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, becauſe they are the Thrones of God, lodging their Soveraign in the innermoſt receſſes of their Eſſence,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ambula per fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ut perveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ad patriam; ſpecies non laeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicat in Patria, quem fides non conſolatur in via.</hi> Aug.</note> and are moſt intimately poſſeſt by him who is infinitely diſtant from the Wicked. Now the Faithful partake of this happineſs with them: Jeſus Chriſt dwells in their hearts by Faith; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that thoſe that believe in him poſſeſs him: <hi>Chriſtum habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare per fidem in cordibus veſtris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who ſo happily expreſſeth the words of this great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, aſſures us that this vertue hath the power to fill us with Jeſus Chriſt; that it makes Heaven ſtoop, and Earth aſcend; and uniting the Faithful with the Beatified, in ſome ſort equals their different conditions. It is a kinde of Miracle, that Faith, which believes onely things diſtant and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, ſhould make us ſee and poſſeſs them, enlightning us by their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and giving us an approach to them by their remoteneſs. For, as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, when we believe in Jeſus Chriſt, we have Jeſus Chriſt in us: This vertue makes him preſent in our ſouls; and the belief we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of him, is his other ſelf in our hearts. Thus the Believer is happie becauſe he poſſeſſeth the Son of God; and is poſſeſſed by him as long as he preſerves a vertue which ſo cloſely unites them together.</p>
                  <p>Hope, which is bred with Faith, increaſeth this happineſs, and makes
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:115672:193"/>our condition more reſemble that of the Bleſſed: For, that which ſeems moſt to ſeparate them from us, is, that they enjoy that happineſs we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that they languiſh not as we do, and that they have received ſeiſen of the Supreme Good we ſtill hope for: They feel the truth of that ſpeech the Scripture hath recorded for our conſolation, <hi>Intra in gaudium Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini tui.</hi> Their Deſires diſturb them not; and Fear, which always accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Hope, troubles not their content: They are above all their wiſhes; and being in full poſſeſſion of the Supreme Good, have neither Miſeries to fear, nor Bleſſings to deſire.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Believers enjoy not all theſe priviledges; neither does their condition ſuffer them to live without apprehenſions and longings: They work out their ſalvation with trembling;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ille bene novit in miſeriis exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioribus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtere qui ſcit de ſpe interna ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per gaudere.</hi> Greg. Mora.</note> and as they poſſeſs not all that they love, they give themſelves leave gently to conſume away in the flames and deſires of their Love. But withal, we muſt confeſs they have a part of this felicity: for all Philoſophers know that Hope is the flower of Pleaſure, that it gives a taſte of the pleaſure it promiſeth, that, to ſtir up the appetite of our Soul, it indulgeth a kinde of ſenſe of the felicity prepared for us, and that the ſtrength ſhe inſpires us with, proceeds from the ſweetneſs ſhe charms our expectation with. I know prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors affirm that the overtures of Hope are but pleaſing Lyes,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Spes vigilantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomnium.</hi> Plut.</note> that ſhe engageth us in dangers with vain promiſes; and finding us over-eaſie, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth our credulity: But the ſounder ſort of Philoſophers acknowledge that Hopes animates us, ſowes pleaſures amidſt our pains, nor ever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries men on to generous and difficult actions, but in making them taſte a part of the recompence ſhe promiſeth.</p>
                  <p>But admit this Paſſion had not all the power attributed to her, we muſt by no means queſtion it as belonging to that Hope which is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the words of God: This confers things in promiſing them, makes us feel the happineſs we expect: and as the Air and the Windes carry the Odours of <hi>Arabia</hi> into the neighbouring Provinces, we may ſay that this vertue carries the felicity of the Beatified into the very heart of the Faithful. Thence it comes to paſs that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> many times in his Epiſtles mingles Joy with Hope; as if he would teach us, that we cannot hope but we muſt poſſeſs in part what we hope for; <hi>Spe gaudentes:</hi> and in another place, <hi>Gloriamur in spe gloriae filiorum Dei.</hi> Finally, if it exclude not all Evils, as Beatitude does, at leaſt it ſweetens them, and turns them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to remedies: S. <hi>Gregory</hi> goes further: for he will have it happie, becauſe certain; and wiping away the tears of Chriſtians, crowns them with a joy which comes neer that of the Angels.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as Charity is nobler then Hope, ſhe contributes more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the Happineſs of the Faithful: For, beſides that it makes the holy Trinity preſent in their ſouls, renders their Exile a Paradiſe, ſhe unites them to God, and by a happy Metamorphoſis findes out an expedient to transform them into him. All the world knows that love is the tye of
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115672:193"/>hearts, and that his principal effect is to unite together all the Subjects that live under his Empire: To accompliſh this deſign, he equals their conditions, debaſeth great perſons, and exalteth mean ones, enricheth the poor, and impoveriſheth the rich, ſets ſlaves at liberty, and makes Maſters ſlaves: But Charity effects all theſe things more happily then profane love; ſhe humbles the Almighty without intereſſing his Greatneſs; obligeth him to comply with our weakneſs;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quis me amavit &amp; non ad me pervenit, quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis me quaerit cum ipſo ſum: ipſe amor tibi praeſentem me facit.</hi> Aug.</note> and reduceth him to a condition wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he enters into commerce with us, not dazling us with his light, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing us with his Majeſty: He infuſeth himſelf into our ſouls by grace, is linkt to us by his love, and in this union communicates to us all his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Qualities: For he lifts us above our ſelves to transform us into him; draws us out of our miſery to make us capable of his happineſs, and takes from us our own affections, to give us admittance into his inclinations: when we are arrived to this height of perfection, we behold all earthly things under our feet; we breath nothing but Heaven; we diſcourſe onely of the ſubject of our love; and we are ſo perfectly filled with him, that we may ſay without offence, our deſires are alike, our conditions equal, and our intereſts common.</p>
                  <p>Though all Chriſtians cannot pretend to this high degree of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it ſeems yet that having the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, they have one part of that felicity which the Saints poſſeſs by Charity: For in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Divines, Grace is Glory begun, Glory Grace conſummated: the former gives that a being here below, which the ſecond finiſheth above, and maugre all the miſeries that afflict the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> makes us finde Happineſs in the midſt of our ſorrows: 'Tis perhaps upon this ground that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls Grace Eternal Life, <hi>Gratia Dei vita aeterna;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates to all Chriſtians, that being Saints here below, they are already Bleſſed.

                  <p>Nevertheleſs Divines confeſs, that as Grace is a participation of the Divine Nature, it communicates Immortality as well as Sanctity, and the life it produceth in our ſouls, carries along with it no principle of death. The life of the body is not a true life, becauſe the ſame elements that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, deſtroy it; and the corruption that accompanies it, leads it inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to a diſſolution. But the life of Grace is exempt from this misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115672:194"/>it carries Eternity along with it, and were it not engaged in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject changeable and obnoxious to mutability, it would be as Immortal as it is Holy.</p>
                  <p>Let us adde to this advantage that Grace cannot be taken from us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our will; 'tis a treaſure we never loſe but by our own default: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable goods cannot be preſerved with all our care; cunning or violence may rob us of them; and whatever prudence we uſe to keep them, we are many times conſtrain'd to fear or feel the loſs of them: Calumny takes away our good name; Injuſtice or misfortune ſpoils us of our riches; a diſeaſe deprives us of health, and death of life: All theſe goods though preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, cannot avoid the diſaſters that threaten them: The Innocent loſe their honour as well as the Guilty; The rich are as much afraid of ſickneſs as the poor; nor are Kings more ſecure from death then their Subjects.

                  <p>OF all the Sects which have oppoſed Truth, the moſt dangerous is that of the Epicures; For though baſe and unjuſt in that it gave the Body preheminence over the Minde, and Pleaſure the right hand of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; Nevertheleſs it ſurpriſed men at firſt ſight, and ſeduced them by a name which bears ſome analogy with that of felicity: For whatever I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea men faſhion of this, it is impoſſible to ſeparate it from Pleaſure, and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115672:194"/>very caſie to confound them together. We cannot imagine ſuch a thing as the ſupream Good, but we muſt conceive it agreeable; nor can we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves that there is felicity where there is not content.</p>
                  <p>This hath procured more Diſciples to this ſhameful Sect, then to all the reſt, and made it triumph over the reaſon of the Academicks, and the ſupercilious vanity of the Stoicks: Allſinners took part with this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy; Chriſtian Religion which deſtroyed Idolatry, hath not been able to ruine this, and the Church bears thoſe in her boſome who boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, but are indeed Epicures. The whole world courts plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by different addreſſes; 'Tis the Idol that hath moſt Altars, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives moſt Sacrifices. The Ambitious are her ſlaves, they adore Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs under the name of Glory, and ſuffer themſelves to be charm'd by the allurements that attend a great reputation: The Covetous are her Votaries, they offer Incenſe to this falſe Deity; they ſeek for pleaſure in the arms of profit; nor do they ſo much doat upon riches, becauſe profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as becauſe agreeable.</p>

                  <p>There is no body but confeſſeth that Beatitude conſiſts in a union with God, by means of the underſtanding and the will: we muſt renounce reaſon to oppoſe this truth, and ceaſe to be men to doubt of a Maxim au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by all profane Philoſophy. God is the Ultimate End of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and conſequently their perfect Happineſs; The Underſtanding and the Will are the two nobleſt faculties of the ſoul, the wings that make her ſoar aloft, and the chains that faſten her to the object ſhe loves; ſo that ſhe is never more happy then when united to the Supream Good by Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Love; whatever hinders this union, is contrary to it; and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeparates or removes her from God, is the enemy of her felicity.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie thence to infer that ſenſual pleaſures cannot cauſe our felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe they ſuffer not our ſouls to be united to God, and imbark her ſo ſtrongly in the fleſh, that ſhe ſeems to have loſt all the qualities of a ſpirit. Impurity produceth ſtore of miſeries in the world, nor can we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent too many invectives againſt a ſin that defiles a man, and of an Angel makes a Beaſt: But the greateſt of its enormities is, that it inebriates our ſoul with its poiſon, and makes us loſe the remembrance of all Divine
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115672:195"/>things: Nothing pleaſeth the ſlaves it tyrannizeth over, but ſenſuality; whatever affects not the ſenſes, ſeems not true; they take the pleaſures of the minde for meer illuſions; and as if the glory of Heaven were but a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or an impoſture, they are leſs affected with the conſideration of them, then reaſonable men with the reading of Romance.</p>
                  <p>This misfortune produceth another; For as pleaſure ſeparates men from God, it faſtens them to the creatures their inferiours, and debaſing them below themſelves,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quiſquis quod ſeitſo eſt deteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſequitur, fit &amp; ipſe de. erior.</hi> Aug.</note> communicates the bad qualities of the things they doat upon. Love is a kind of medley, it confounds thoſe ſubjects it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, and by a wonderful Chymiſtry makes them paſs one into another. Thence it comes to paſs that Kings become Slaves when they love their Subjects, and renounce their power when abandon'd to dalliance: They fall from their Greatneſs when they engage in an affection; and as the nobleſt metals loſe their purity when mixt with thoſe of a baſer allay, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns quit their Majeſty when allied with their Subjects. Thus the man who gluts himſelf with the pleaſures of the body, renounceth the priviledges of the minde, betrays his duty and his dignity, deſpoils him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the inclinations of Angels, and puts on thoſe of Beaſts; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing his ſhape, changeth condition and nature.</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as moſt men are led more by intereſt then reaſon, and thoſe that are the ſlaves of pleaſure are more ſenſible of grief then ſhame and diſhonour; it will not be amiſſe in this Diſcourſe to let them ſee that the pleaſures after which they ſo eagerly run, are very tragical, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their intention, are turn'd into puniſhments. The Divine Juſtice which leaves no crime unpuniſhed, hath been pleaſed that diſeaſes ſhould be natural penances, and that the Stone and the Gout ſhould be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of our debauches: Seeing ſenſuall pleaſures are commonly cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, they are for the moſt part irregular; having ſhaken off the yoak of reaſon, they caſt men into exceſſe, and perſwade them that 'tis a kind of injuſtice and baſe ſervility to preſcribe Laws to their deſires: abuſed by theſe falſe ſophiſms, they purſue their inclinations without keeping any meaſure in their diverſions; they are drown'd in delights, are loſt in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe, and draining their ſtrength and their ſubſtance, fall many times into diſeaſes and poverty: Thus by a juſt judgement of Heaven their diſorders become their torments,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ipſos voluptas habet, non ipſi voluptatem; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus aut inopiâ torquentur, aut copiâ ſtrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantur; miſeri ſi deſeruntur ab illa, miſeriores ſi obruantur.</hi> Sence.</note> and they finde ſorrow where they expected felicity.</p>
                  <p>If to defend themſelves from this misfortune, they obſerve ſome rules in their pleaſures, they feel another puniſhment: For theſe pleaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort, their ſoul is always languiſhing; they have ſcarce done with one, but they long for another; and living always in expectation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, can neither be ſecure from reſtleſneſſe nor diſcontent: Thoſe who to remedy this evil, endeavour to aſſociate pleaſures, undertake an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility: For whether nature intend to puniſh us, becauſe we are culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or whether Grace be not willing to expoſe us to danger, becauſe we
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115672:195"/>are weak, Pleaſures hold not ſo good intelligence as Paines: Theſe ſet upon us in a full body, and joyn companies to render us wretched: the Stone, the Gout, the Colick, and the Palſie, conſpire together to exerciſe our patience: whatever oppoſition theſe diſeaſes may have, they agree to ruine us; and we many times behold diſtreſſed ſpectacles who have no part of their body free from torment: But Pleaſures are divided; Self-love, with all its ſubtilties, cannot reconcile them; the Birth of one is the Death of another; and experience teacheth us, that we have more ſtrength to endure Griefs, then to ſupport pleaſures: when theſe ſlow in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with full tide, they ſtifle us; when they ſucceed, they make us droop and languiſh; and when they recompenſe their ſhortneſs by their exceſs, they reduce us to complaints and groanings.</p>
                  <p>From all this Diſcourſe we may conclude, that bodily pleaſure is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to our happineſs, that it removes us from God, engageth us in the Creature, obligeth us to partake of their imperfections, and is followed with miſery and indigence. Therefore, following the rule of Contraries, we ſhall not have much ado to perſwade our ſelves, that Felicity may be found in Grief, and that the Chriſtian is never more happie then when he is afflicted for Chriſts ſake.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of this Paradox, we muſt remember that all earthly goods are onely mediums whereby to gain thoſe of heaven: that which leads us the ſafeſt way thither, is the beſt; neither is the Chriſtian ever neerer his happineſs, then when he is in the way that ſooneſt leads him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now there is no man ſo little skilled in our myſteries, but knows that Grief is the ſureſt and the ſpeedieſt way to arrive at heaven;

                  <p>One of the moſt remarkable differences between Chriſtian Grace and Original Righteouſneſs, is, that this guided man to his happineſs thorow a way ſtrewed with roſes and lilies; the means were proportioned to the end, and ſeemed as an Antepaſt or Earneſt thereof; He arrived to Glory by Honour, to Pleaſure by Delights, to Plenty by Riches: He had reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over Beaſts, before he raigned with Angels: he had paſſed from one Paradiſe to another; and had been happie upon Earth, before he had been ſo in Heaven. But now Providence hath changed its conduct over men; and, whether it have a minde to chaſtiſ their Rebellion, or to wean them from the World, or to make them conformable to their Head, it leads them by difficult ways, thorow paths rugged with thorns, and environed with precipices: The means it indulgeth to bring them to their end, are contrary to it; and, to make its proceeding admired, they are guided to Life thorow the valley of Death, to Liberty thorow Servitude, to Light tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:115672:196"/>Darkneſs, to Pleaſure thorow Pain. All the Morality of a Chriſtian propoundeth nothing but Croſſes; its Vertues are auſtere, its Counſels difficult, its Commands harſh; and had it not found the means to ſweeten all theſe anxities by Charity, it would reduce the Faithful to deſpair: For it obligeth them to hate Themſelves, and to love their Enemies; orders them to forſake their Riches and their Parents;

                  <p>All the Maximes of their Maſter confirm this Truth: for he prefers the Poor before the Rich, declares the Afflicted happie, canonizeth them that ſuffer, and promiſeth his Kingdom to them that weep: he practiſed what he taught; his whole life was ſpent in labours, or affronts; he was born in a Stable, died upon a Croſs, loſt his Honour with his Life: nor did his Father glorifie him, till his Enemies had loaded him with reproaches and ſorrows. All his Apoſtles followed his ſteps; they preached his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with the hazard of their lives, ſigned it with their blood, ſealed it with their death, rendered up their ſouls among torments; nor is there any torture the cruelty of men hath not invented, to weary their Patience, and trample upon their Courage.</p>
                  <p>All his faithful diſciples ſeek for Grief in the Reſt of the Church; they finde Perſecution in Penance, are their own executioners, and their whole life is an imitation of Martyrdom: they provide for the Priſon by Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, diſpoſe themſelves for Baniſhment by removing from their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, prevent the loſs of their goods by Alms, grow hardened againſt Stripes by Diſcipline, grow acquainted with Hunger by Faſting, and learn to die in Torments, mortifying themſelves by Auſterities. Nothing more heartens them then the example of their Head; his Agonies ſweeten their Sorrows; they count themſelves happie to ſuffer for his glory who ſuffered for their ſalvation; and obſerving his whole life, finde their ſtrength in his death, and their recompence in his reſurrection.</p>

                  <head>The Fifth DISCOURSE. <hi>That Happineſs is rather found in Poverty then in Riches.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe inclination we have for the Supreme Good is ſo ſtrong, that ſin hath not as yet been able to deface it: The Privation there of increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the deſire; and as Health is never more lovely then in the region of Sickneſs, neither is Happineſs ever more acceptable then in the confines of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:115672:196"/>Miſery: Nevertheleſs we muſt not always take counſel of this, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice it always gives us: for when we lie under an affliction, we are eaſily perſwaded 'tis ever more dolorous, and the good it deprives us of exceedingly more conſiderable. Thus we ſee thoſe that are fallen into diſgrace, look upon Glory as the ſupreme felicity; thoſe that live in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, imagine Riches the true happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs that Poverty being a very common misfortune, the opinion that placeth happineſs in Plenty is an ordinary errour. All men would be rich; this paſſion ſtealeth into all different conditions; and thoſe that ſpeak moſt pompouſly of the contempt of earthly goods,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eſt intolerabilis res poſcere num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos &amp; contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, &amp; pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſub gloria paupertatis quarere.</hi> Sen.</note> are thoſe that moſt greedily cover them. It ſeems the evils that Want hath clogged them with, provokes their deſires; and the fear of realpſing makes them of all men moſt penurious: Rich men ſooth themſelves with this belief, out of another conſideration: and becauſe they ſee that Riches are the means to ſatisfie their deſires, that they open the gate of Honour with a golden-key, corrupt the integrity of Judges and the chaſtity of women with ſilver, they erect altars to a Goddeſs that proſpers all their unjuſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. Morality furniſheth us with Reaſons to ruine this errour; and Religion will afford us Maximes to perſwade Chriſtians, that if there be any ſhadow of felicity upon earth, it is rather found in Poverty then in Plenty.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt ſplendid conditions of the Supreme Good, is, that it is the centre of our Love, and the end of our Deſires: That which leaves us any thing to wiſh, is not true; and becauſe it fully takes not up our heart, it poſſeſſeth not all perfections: This obligeth us to deſpiſe riches, and to condemn thoſe worldings that would eſtabliſh their felicity in them. For if they bear the name of Goods, 'tis an unjuſt title they uſurp, becauſe for the moſt part they are means Nature hath furniſhed us with to procure what we ſtand in need of. The uſe of Riches is for Commerce; we give them in exchange for the commodities we would have; and if ſometimes we keep them, 'tis to make uſe of them in our neceſſities. Thus Riches are extremely different from the Supreme Good, which, being once poſſeſſed, is never forſaken; and is ſo the laſt end of Man, that it can never be a medium to arrive at any other more excellent.</p>
                  <p>All Philoſophers confeſs that Felicity is a thing ſo intimately annexed to the Creature, that it penetrates him thorewout; and ſo cloſely united to him, that it cannot be ſeparated: If it have not theſe two conditions, Man will never be perfectly happie; there will be ſome faculty of his ſoul which unſatisfied will remain languiſhing; and when they ſhall all enjoy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, he will ſtill be liable to fear, leſt haply he may be deſpoiled of the Good he poſſeſſeth: Now Riches want one of theſe two conditions; they ſurround us but no ways inform us; they are in our coffers, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not into out hearts we commit the keeping of them to our ſervants; and we are conſtrained to aband on our felicity as often as we take a journey.</p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:115672:197"/>
                  <p>This misfortune cauſeth another: For, being not under ſafe cuſtody, they are expoſed to pillage: Injuſtice and violence may plunder us of them: and though Gold be the ſinews of War, 'tis in his power that hath the beſt Sword to take it from us. Thus Riches create Fear, expoſe their maſters or their ſlaves to danger; and whatever ſuccour they promiſe, procure us more ill then they bring good.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould they be as good as their word, and were it eaſie for us to keep them, yet could they not give us a protection from the evil whereof they boaſt themſelves the remedy:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cum dicitur ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil illi deeſt, attende; ſi nihil cupit nihil deeſt; ſi autem adhuc cupit, acceſſerunt divitiae ut ege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtas creſceret.</hi> Aug.</note> For if there be any miſery in the world which Riches can cure us of, it muſt be Poverty: It ſeems, as ſoon as they enter into a houſe, they baniſh Want; and that 'tis impoſſible to be rich and poor both together: In the mean time, experience teacheth us that Riches introduce Poverty, that they inflame our deſires, ſharpen our diſeaſe under a pretence of mitigating it; and, for our puniſhment, beget indigence in our hearts, at the ſame time that they occaſion plenty in our houſe. All prophane Philoſophy hath acknowledged this Truth; and the Stoicks have confeſſed it, that the moſt biting poverty was that which we ſuffer in the midſt of our Riches.</p>
                  <p>This juſt judgement hath two cauſes: The firſt is the capacity of mans heart, which none but an infinite Good can fill: the ſecond is, the ſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of riches, which increaſe our appetite in ſtead of allaying it, and, like a handful of water thrown upon a great fire, ſerves onely to make it ſcorch more violently. Thence may we conclude with the Philoſopher, that the richer a man is, the more miſerable is he; that his riches impoveriſh him, if Grace do not inſtruct him how to moderate his deſires: ſo that what he lookt upon as a remedy, is a ſecond evil more dangerous then that he would cure.</p>
                  <p>This conceit diſcovers another, which makes it evident, that in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereto ſin hath reduced man, Riches are more pernicious then proſitable: Every one knows that the inordinateneſs of our Paſſions is one of the ſevereſt puniſhments of our tranſgreſſion: there is ſcarce one that is not rebellious againſt Reaſon, and which attempts not the violation of his authority: All our Deſires are unjuſt, all our Hopes intereſſed, all our Affections criminal: every Paſſion produceth a ſin, if not withheld by Grace; and whoever gives himſelf up to his inclinations, is ſure to wander from his duty. In the mean time, Riches ſide with theſe rebels againſt their Soveraign; they flatter all our deſires, ſerve as miniſters to all our unjuſt deſignes, and furniſh us with means to make us more culpable, under a colour of rendering us more happie. They promiſe pleaſures to the Wanton,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Inflant animos divitiae, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biam pariunt, invidiam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahunt, luxui ſerviunt.</hi> Sen.</note> and conſpire with him to corrupt Chaſtity: they furniſh Arms and Seconds to the Furious, to take vengeance on their enemies: they raiſe the Ambitious to offices and employments; and complying with all Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, engage men in all kinde of impiety. Therefore he judged aright, who ſaid, that, to give a ſinful man Riches, was to put a Sword into a mad mans
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:115672:197"/>hand or preſent poyſon to a Deſperado; becauſe not being under the command of Grace, he will make uſe of them only to ſatisfie his ambition, or to content his brutality.</p>
                  <p>So that the Philoſophers preventing the Divines, rightly diſcovered that Poverty was more Innocent then Plenty; and that it was eaſier for men to preſerve their liberty in the leanneſs of want then in the affluence of riches. For beſides that they wed us to the earth,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Multis paraſſe divitias non finis miſeriaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fuit ſed muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> Senec. Epiſt. 17.</note> they expoſe us to a thouſand accidents which can neither be foreſeen nor avoided, and give fortune game at our perſon. Therefore is it that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, Thoſe that will be happy, muſt either be poor, or like thoſe that are ſo; they muſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe their goods without being poſſeſſed by them; and uſe them as Stewards rather then Proprietaries; and they ought to be alwayes ready to part with them, becauſe they have them but in truſt: Religion out-bids Philoſophy, and requires farre other diſpoſitions from her Children, then this does from her Diſciples: For ſhe will have them acknowledg that in <hi>Adam</hi> all is loſt; that they are fallen from their rights by his ſin, and being guilty are become miſerable: Perſwaded of this Truth, they live in the world as in a ſtrange Country; they poſſeſſe riches upon Loan; and ſince their Goods were confifcated to their ſoveraign, they enjoy them meerly from his mercy: Though Jeſus Chriſt re-inſtate them in their goods; and being made Co-heirs with him, may diſpoſe of heaven and earth as their Inheritance; yet are they obliged to regulate themſelves by his Example, and not to make uſe of their rights till after the generall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</p>
                  <p>He carried himſelf thus during his life; though Heire to his Father, he diſpoſed not of his eſtate, a Cratch received him at his birth, and a Croſs ſerved him for a Death-bed; he lodged in a borrowed houſe, and was buried in a ſtrangers Sepulchre: If he wrought ſome miracles for the Glory of his Father, he did none for his own Intereſt; when he created a piece of money in the mouth of a Fiſh, it was to pay Tribute; and when he commanded his Diſciples to take the Aſſe which ſerved to carry him in his triumph, it was with the conſent of the Owner.

The Chriſtians tredding in his ſteps, pretend nothing in this world, but reſerve the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their right for the next: They are content with the promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, and living here upon hope, expect the effects thereof in glory.</p>
                  <p>During this time, they look upon Poverty as an innocent Uſury, which gives a value to what they give or part with here for the Son of God; for they know, ſaith S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt who is a New Man, is come down here below to teach us new things; and that thoſe that obey him, finde reſt in labour, liberty in ſervitude, and abundance in Poverty. Their Goods are multiplyed in being diſtributed; and as the husbandman
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:115672:198"/>caſting his ſeed into the earth, promiſeth himſelf a hapgy harveſt; the Chriſtian in communicating his goods to the Poor, expects a great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence at the generall Reſurrection. Till then he comforts himſelf with the advantages Poverty beſtows upon him: for he perceives that if riches have their good uſe, they have alſo their bad: They acknowledge the Cuſtody of them troubleſome, the love of them contagious, the loſſe of them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and if there be pain to get them, there is more to keep them.</p>
                  <p>This made ſome Philoſophers rid themſelves of ſuch attendants, and gave comfort to others whom injuſtice or fortune had made bankrupt: for as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes excellently well, We gain much in loſing our riches, if with them we loſe our covetouſneſs; and we fail not continually to gain ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing even when we loſe it not; becauſe the ſubject that entertained it being taken away, there is ſome ground to hope either that it will dye for want of nouriſhment, or at leaſt do no hurt for want of power. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of Chriſtians is happier in this point then that of Philoſophers: for being inanimated with Grace, they loſe the deſire of evil with the meanes of doing it; nor are they innocent only out of impotency but out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation. They make their Poverty meritorious in making it voluntary; if they chooſe it not, they endevour to accept it, and a misfortune or a chaſtiſement they husband into a vertue: The loſſe of their Goods cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the aſſurance of their ſalvation, and the reſt of their ſouls; they ceaſe to fear aſſoon as they ceaſe to love, and they draw this advantage from their poverty, that being no longer engaged to the Earth by their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they are no more troubled with fear nor abuſed with hope.</p>
                  <p>But their greateſt happineſs is, that they learn from Scripture, that their condition is a holy <hi>Aſylum,</hi> and that heaven hath promiſed a particular protection to the Poor:
<note place="margin">

Let us love Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty then and deſpiſe riches; ſeek Felicity in want: and if Nature hath not brought us poor into the world, let us become like thoſe that are poor, either by unbottoming our ſelves of our Goods, or diſtributing them; that raking part in the reproaches of Chriſt upon Earth, We may be partakers of glory in heaven.</p>

Riches are not more faithfull then Pleaſures, and as they deſcend not with our Bodies into the Grave, neither doe they paſs with our ſouls into the other world: But Glory is inſeparable from Vertue, as the ſhadow from Light; it is the onely Inheritance the dead may diſpoſe of, that which makes them ſurvive in the world, and preſerves them from oblivion after their diſſolution. Finally, Honour and Vertue are ſo cloſely combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they cannot be divided without occaſioning their deſtruction; They are Twins whoſe deſtiny is ſo like, that the Death of the one leaves the other liveleſſe, and the onely way to baniſh vertue out of the world, is to exterminate Glory thence, which ſerves her for a nouriſhment and a recompence.</p>
                  <p>But whatever the Ambitious would ſay, there needs but a little reaſon to confeſſe that there is nothing in the world more jejunely brittle then Glory; nor that men ever treated vertue more injuriouſly then when they aſſigned Honour for her Recompence. For if Glory be a Good, 'tis a ſtrange one, and is oftner the fortunate mans portion, then the deſervings Honorary: It reacheth not always to us; and when diſpenced with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, it reſts in the minde of thoſe that know or publiſh our worth; ſo that we ſhould be happy without knowing it, and receive honour without any contentment.</p>
                  <p>But certainly, did we know it, our ſatisfaction would not be the more: For the Good that produceth Beatitude muſt be conſtant and immutable; if it be ſubject to change, 'tis to loſs; and whatever good may fail is not
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:115672:199"/>productive of true felicity: Now there is nothing in the world that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends more upon fortune then honour; 'tis the work of opinion, 'tis a rumour founded upon the Capriciouſneſs of the people, who look upon nothing but appearances, and in their Judgements, for the moſt part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult nothing but their intereſt or pleaſure. If Conquerors are unhappy becauſe victories which are their maſter-peices depend upon fortune, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them not leſs miſerable, becauſe Glory, which is the reward of their courage depends upon the opinion of the vulgar; and that in this point their Subjects and their Souldiers become their Judges and their Soveraigns.</p>
                  <p>If their Felicity be ſuch that they can force men to render them that honour they deſerve, they ought to take heed leaſt thoſe that commend them deceive;

                  <p>But who knows not that vertue is too generous to ſeek her felicity where ſhe will not ſo much as look for her reward? ſhe looks upon honour as her ſlave rather then her maſter; and when ſhe acts, ſhe conſults not ſo much her reputation as her conſcience: ſhe is ſo noble that ſhe looks after no other end but God; and ſo juſt, that ſhe requires no other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but he that muſt be her Judge. This Maxim is not ſo ſevere, but it hath been embraced by Philoſophers: For though the Romans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this outrage againſt vertue as to ſubject it to Glory; and theſe grand Politicians, to animate their Citizens to generous and difficult acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, had perſwaded them that none entred into the Temple of Honour, but through that of Vertue: yet <hi>Seneca</hi> rightly acknowledged that there was injuſtice in this proceeding; that it was to ſubject the Soveraign to his ſlave; and that ſometimes there were occaſions offered where a man muſt betray his Honour to preſerve his Vertue. Piety had taught the chaſt <hi>Suſanna</hi> this Maxim, when ſeeing that ſhe could not preſerve her chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without the loſſe of her reputation, ſhe ſacrificed her honour to her duty, and preferred the approbation of Angels to the opinion and eſteem of men.</p>
                  <p>Glory then is not the true happineſs of Chriſtians, becauſe they are obliged to renounce it; and there is great reaſon to believe, that Humility hath more Analogy with Beatitude, becauſe it accompanies the Bleſſed in the midſt of their Grandeurs. Indeed this vertue is the foundation of Chriſtian Religion; it is that which the Son of God came to teach us by his words and actions; The way he held to come to us, and that we muſt walk in to come to him: Let us explain theſe Verities, and make it appear that the true Glory of a Chriſtian conſiſts in Humility. This vertue is ſo neceſſary, and withall ſo difficult, that God was fain to become Man to teach it us: Philoſophers who were informed with vain glory, knew not the name of it; and if it came amongſt them, it paſt rather for a fault then a perfection. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confeſſed, that Modeſty was a ſpecies of Vertue, but conſiſting in a mediocrity,

The Incarnate Wiſdom opening his School upon Earth, taught us not the ſecret to create worlds, to dart thunderbolts, to govern ſtates, but to mitigate our anger, to abaſe our pride.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as he became like us in humbling himſelf, we become like him laying our ſelves low; and by a ſtrange prodigy humility gives us
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:115672:200"/>acceſſe to him; as Pride puts us at a diſtance from him, Man was ruined in ſtriving to grow great; his vanity gave birth to his miſery; nor did he fall from his Greatneſſe, but becauſe he would climbe above his defarts: To draw him out of this abyſſe, the Son of God threw himſelf into it, and to place him higher then the Angels, he deſcended lower then Man: He was laden with their ſins and languiſhings, that by different degrees he might deſcend to the very Center of debaſement. His humility was the paſſage to his glory; his Father exalted him, becauſe he vouchſafed to be humbled; and his Croſſe, which was the laſt proof of his Patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Fountain of his Greatneſſe. According to his example, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſpire to honour, but by humility; we enter into grace by lowlineſs; arrive at glory by humility; and we finde that this vertue producing its contrary, reſtores us thoſe high immunities Vanitie had raviſhed from us.</p>
                  <p>If after death it lead us to glory, whilſt we live it gives us ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſts thereof, nor are we ever more content then when moſt humble. The Earth is not the manſion of pleaſure, becauſe in it man is always expoſed to danger; he findes enemies in all places; and which way ſoever he turns, he is apprehenſive of detriment: Proſperity makes him inſolent; the ſweetneſs that flatters, corrupts him; and this pleaſing enemy hath no charms which may not engage him in ſin.

                  <p>The holy Scripture, which cannot flatter Soveraigns, and ranks them among ſlaves, when compared with the Almighty; makes them paſs for Gods when compared with men; it preſcribes no bounds to their power; allots them no Judge but their Creator; and whatever exorbitance they have committed, teacheth us, they are to render an account to none but him from whom they hold their Crown: If Prieſts have a power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, God onely hath a right to puniſh them; and when they abuſe their Authority, their ſubjects have only prayers and tears to reduce them to their duty.

                  <p>Their power is not leſs weak then it is ſhort; and if Kings be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe mortal, they are to be pitied becauſe expoſed to ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Weakneſs is natural to them, and Puiſſance accidental: they cannot defend themſelves but with borrowed hands, and mercenary Arms: though their Souldiers be their Subjects, yet may they be debauched; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Oath they engage them with to aſſure their Fidelity, they have reaſon to tremble as often as they think that their State and Perſon depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Courage and Conſtancy of another.

I forbear to ſpeak of the dangers that threaten their ſalvation as well as their power: nor doe I intend to make a Catalogue of the faults they may poſſibly commit in Government, though it be an infallible proof that Bleſſedneſs is not to be found in Royalty: I am content with the holy Scripture, to ſay, That Kings cannot ſin ſecretly; Their Devotion is a ſcandall to the whole State, They authorize the Evil they commit; infect their ſubjects by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and as they are guilty of the ſins they hinder not; ſo, doe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves when they commit thoſe they puniſh; and by their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons give their Edicts the lye.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſſe that Chriſtians finding more ſecurity in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence then in command, place their felicity in it, and never think themſelves happier then when they follow the motions of their Soveraign: ſo that they have this advantage, in humbling themſelves they are exalted, and ſubmitting to God bring all the Creatures under their ſubjection. For Man by ſubmiſſion enters into the Soveraignty of his Creator,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Magna utilitas eſt hominis ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benti Deo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vire, jubendo enim Deus utile facit quicquid jubere voluerit.</hi> Aug.</note> neither is any thing impoſſible to him, when he obeys him that is Almighty. Thus we ſee S. <hi>Peter</hi> walking upon the water at the command of the Son of God; how this Element became ſolid under his feet, reſpects his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or reverenceth Jeſus Chriſt in his perſon: Mans Body could never pretend to the glorious qualities of the ſoul, were it not ſubject to her will; but ſoaring above it ſelf in obedience to her commands, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing words to expreſs her minde, reports the meaning of others; and offers ſome kinde of violence to it ſelf, to be ſubſervient to her deſignes; ſhee acknowledgeth the fidelity of its ſervices in Glory, and aſſociating it to her own happineſs, communicates to it agility, light, and ſubtlety. Thus may we ſay, that the man who obeys God becomes Divine, paſſeth into the condition of him that commands, and deſpoyling himſelf of his miſeries, puts on the majeſty of his Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>Transformation, which is accounted a principall effect of Love, is a priviledge alſo of obedience; we are changed into God by ſubmiſſion as well as by Charity; and God takes as much pleaſure to exalt his ſervants as his Friends: He gives Empires to his people when they obey his word, and obligeth himſelf to raiſe them higher then all the nations of the world when they keep his commandments: <hi>Si audieris voces Domini tui, faciet te excelſiorem omnibus Gentibus.</hi> If man become God by ſubmiſſion, he degenerates into a beaſt by diſobedience. As long as Originall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſubjected the ſpirit to God, it ſubjected the Body to the ſpirit; Man felt no revolts in his perſon; and though compoſed of fleſh and blood, had none but reaſonable inclinations: But aſſoon as he loſt the reſpect was
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:115672:202"/>due to God, his Body rebelled againſt his Soul; he beheld irregular mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which made him extreamly aſhamed; and wondred, that being ſtill a man, he felt the diſorders of a Beaſt. Finally, Obedience is more acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable to God then Sacrifice, and more honourable to man then the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Triumph: <hi>Melior est Obedientia quàm Sacrificium.</hi> Though God have reſerved this Homage for himſelf, and there is none but he alone to whom Victims are to be offered, yet he prefers the merit of Obedience before the honour of Sacrifice; and accounts himſelf more hallowed by him that ſtoops to his Word, then that offers him Holocauſts. Nor are we to wonder at it, ſaith S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> becauſe in our ſacrifices we offer nothing but Bulls or other beaſts; but by our Obedience we immolate our wils and affections.</p>
                  <p>For this very reaſon is it more honourable then Triumphs,

In the mean time there is no action wherein humane Prudence hath leſs part: Fortune preſides over Battles, accidents occaſion good ſucceſſes, and many times the Duſt and the Sun rob the moſt Courageous of their victory: But admit all theſe misfortunes which cannot be avoided, have no wayes aſſiſted the Conquerour; he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily confeſs that his Prudence is beholding to the valour of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and in vain hath he gallantly commanded, if he be not honeſtly obey'd.

                  <head>The Eighth DISCOURSE. <hi>What is the Happineſſe of a Chriſtian in Heaven, and wherein it conſiſts.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BLeſſedneſs hath ſo much relation to God, that whatever is ſaid of the One, may be affirmed of the other. God is infinite, his Greatneſs hath no bounds, he includes his whole State within himſelf; nor does his power produce any thing which is not contained in his Eſſence. Bleſſedneſs is infinite, and the pleaſure it promiſeth is bounded neither with extent
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:115672:203"/>nor duration: God comprehends all imaginable perfections; nothing is diſperſed in the creature which is not recollected in the Creator; and he poſſeſſeth aſwel the brightneſs of the Stars, as the beauty of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and the fruitfulneſs of the fields. <hi>Beatitude</hi> is an Epitome of all pleaſures; nothing is wanting to him that enjoys all things; and according to the opinion of Philoſophers it is a coacervation of all ſolid and true goods.</p>
                  <p>But inaſmuch as God is ſo great that he cannot be conceived, that his divine perfections raiſe him above our thoughts, nor can we praiſe him but by wonder and ſilence; Bleſſedneſs is ſo excellent that we cannot ſo much as form an Idea of it, we want words wherewith to expreſſe its excellencies; and the Scripture tels us, <hi>That eye hath not ſeen, Eare hath not heard, neither hath it entred into the heart of man to conceive the happineſs God hath laid up for them that love him.</hi> This laſt condition would impoſe ſilence upon us, if the liberty we take to ſpeak of God, though incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible, did not permit me to write of Bleſſedneſs, though unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: But as we cannot fail, when treating of the perfections of God, we follow the light of Faith; I believe neither ſhall I wander in this vaſt Ocean of Glory,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui ducem ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur, fidem à veritate nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam poteſt aberrare.</hi> Aug.</note> if I ſayl by that Star; and however, ſhipwrack is not to be feared upon a ſea where all thoſe that are Drowned may boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Happy.</p>
                  <p>Scripture, which is our guide in the myſteries of Religion, teacheth us, that Beatitude conſiſts in the love and knowledg of God. For that which hath deliver'd theſe words, <hi>Haec eſt vita aeterna, ut cognaſcant te ſolu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verum Deum,</hi> hath told us alſo, <hi>Qui manet in Charitate, in Deo manet, &amp; Deus in eo.</hi> Knowledg would cool without Love, and Love would be blinde without Knowledg: All the faculties of our ſoul muſt finde their ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in felicity; The Underſtanding muſt ſee the Truth it believes; the Will poſſeſſe the good it loves; the Memory be filled with theſe two Things it hath ſo carefully recorded:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ita ſunt poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae in eſſentia anima inter ſe conjunctae, ut quicquid unam laedit, alias lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat neceſſe eſt.</hi> Marſ. Fiſc.</note> If theſe Three Faculties be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſomething will be wanting to the Chriſtians felicity; and as they are united in one and the ſame ſoul, the pain of the one would be the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other. When the Scripture ſeems ſometimes to give the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to Knowledg over Love, or to Love over Knowledg, it is only more ſtrongly to expreſs the excellency of both; and to make us comprehend, that as he that clearly ſees God is happy, he that perfectly loves him can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be miſerable.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes to paſs that the Fathers of the Church are divided up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, whereof ſome have taken the part of Knowledg, others that of Love.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Del viſio ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num bonum.</hi> Aug.</note> S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> though the Panegyriſt of Love, hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo fully expreſſed himſelf in many paſſages of his Writings in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of Knowledg, that he ſeems to have forgotten what he delivered elſwhere concerning Love: For he will have the End of all our Actions, and the repoſe of all our Deſires to be found in beholding the ſupreme
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115672:203"/>Good: That as he is miſerable, who knowing all things, knows not the Creator that made them; he likewiſe is happy that knows the Creator; nor is there any addition to his happineſs, in that he knows the creatures together with him. Finally, he ſaith in another place, that the clear vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God is the whole recompence of a Chriſtian, and that nothing can be wanting to his happineſs when he fully contemplates the Divine Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>But there are a thouſand places beſide where this Great Doctor pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Felicity in Love, and repreſents the Bleſſed to us as ſo many Lovers who finde their contentment in the poſſeſſion of the Supream Good. Thus, ſaith he, true Happineſs conſiſts in that joy which ariſeth from Truth known, and Goodneſs beloved:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Beata quippe vita eſt gaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de veritate, hoc enim eſt gaudium de te qui veritas es.</hi> Aug.</note> He aſſures us that the Bleſſed have no other employment then to love God; and that all the vertues are uſeleſs in Heaven except Charity: He teacheth us, that enjoyment, which is the Reſt of Love, is alſo its Recompence; that as deſires diſquiet Lovers, when they poſſeſs not what they long for, the Divine Eſſence would be a torment to the Bleſſed, if from their underſtanding it paſt not to their will; and if having illuminated them with its light, it warmed them nor with its flames. Knowledge then and Love make up the felicity of the Saints in glory; but both of them are very different from that which is found among the Faithful.</p>
                  <p>Our knowledge is always mixt with darkneſs; faith though certain, is notwithſtanding obſcure; and though an effuſion of the light of glory, hath not its extent nor evidence. We ſee God but in Enigma's upon Earth; the ſpecies that diſcover him, conceal him; Theſe glaſſes are too narrow to give us a full repreſentation of his Greatneſs, and our ſpirits are too weak to bear the luſtre of his Majeſty: But in Heaven he fortifies the Bleſſed by the Light of Glory, gives them a capacity to look upon him; and piercing their underſtanding, is himſelf both the ſpecies and the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                  <p>There are three things in the world which oppoſe our Happineſs, and ſuffer us not to know God perfectly: The firſt is his Greatneſs, which da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies or aſtoniſheth us; whence it comes to paſs, that the Scriptures aſſign him for his abode either light that hides him from us, or darkneſs that robs us of him: The ſecond is his abſence; for though he be every where, yet is he at a diſtance when he will; and as his preſence is not fixed to the Earth which he fils; ſo is it true, to affirm of him that he is no where, as to ſay he is in all places; <hi>Nullibi eſt qui ubique eſt.</hi> The third is the weakneſs of mans ſoul, which cannot ſuffer the preſence of his God, &amp; finds the condign puniſhment of his pride, where he ſought for the ſatisfaction of his curioſity: But all theſe impediments are taken away from the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; The Majeſty of God is no longer formidable; his Greatneſs which occaſions our aſtoniſhment, gives being to their felicity; and love having baniſhed from their hearts all fear, they treat with their Soveraign as with
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115672:204"/>their Beloved. The abſence of the Supream Good cauſeth not their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance; They are poſſeſſed by him whom they poſſeſs; his Divine Eſſence penetrates their very ſouls, and they are ſo full of him, that thoſe who ſee them are obliged to reverence them as Gods. Finally, the weakneſs of their faculties hinders not their contentment; the ſame fire that burns them, inanimates them; the ſame light that clarifies, ſtrengthens them; and the ſame God that ſearcheth all their inward parts, preſerves them.</p>
                  <p>If their Knowledge have this advantage, their Love hath yet more, and their Charity is much perfecter then ours: Whatever pains we take to love God upon Earth, our Love is never without ſome notable defects which enfeeble it: It is blind, becauſe Faith that enlightens it, is a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle whoſe lamp is always ſurrounded with a cloud or ſmoak: It is faint and drooping, becauſe we poſſeſs not the Supream Good which we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately affect; and being ſeparated from him, we are as well his Martyrs as his Lovers: It is divided, becauſe ſelf-love is not yet extinguiſhed; and the greateſt Saints, if they manage not their intentions well, rob God of all the Love they indulge themſelves. Finally, it is almoſt ever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quicquid crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura ſui amori concedit, hoc amori Dei eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.</hi> Bern.</note> we love not God ſo purely as not to ſeek our own pleaſure with when his glory; and we are more earneſt with him for riches or honours then for graces, we make it appear that Concupiſcence bears a greater part in our prayers then Charity.</p>
                  <p>But the Bleſſed have not one of theſe imperfections in their Love: It is not blind, becauſe they love him whom they ſee; and the brightneſs of glory that enlightens them, is a ray diſpelling all darkneſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: It languiſheth not as ours doth, nor ſpends it ſelf in its own long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, becauſe they poſſeſſe what they love; and being intimately united to God, are eternally inſeparable from him: It is not divided, becauſe ſelf-love enters not into Heaven, but is quenched by the flames of Charity, or purified when the ſouls of the Bleſſed quit the Priſon of their body. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, it is not intereſſed, becauſe the honour of God is the end of their deſires; and in felicity it ſelf, they ſeek not ſo much their own happineſs as his glory.</p>
                  <p>From this Knowledge and this Love, is derived the reſemblance the Bleſſed have with God, which is the accompliſhment of their deſires, and the perfection of their Beatitude: For though the Faithful be humble, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire not to the vain pomps of the world, and being conſcious of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, knows very well that Nothingneſs is his Original, and ſin his work; yet ceaſeth he not to wiſh by the motions of Grace what he ſometimes cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the impulſes of pride. He would have the ſame thing that <hi>Adam</hi> would; like the Angel he pretends to be like God; but he deſires that with Juſtice which the two others did with Inſolence: The holy Scripture au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſeth his appetite, and the promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt make his hopes lawful: He knows very well that the Happineſs of a reaſonable creature conſiſts particularly in this point; and that being the Image of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:115672:204"/>and in Grace, he ought to reſemble him in Glory: The beloved diſciple comforts us in the expectation of this happineſs, and ſpeaks ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently of it to all the Faithful, that he ſeems rather to have received the Earneſt then the Promiſe of his Maſter. <hi>Scimus quoniam cùm apparuerit, ſimiles ei erimus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this ſimilitude conſtitute our principal happineſs, yet is it eaſier to hope for it then to deſcribe it; and being an expreſſion of the felicity of God himſelf, is as much unknown to us as his: Nevertheleſs we may ſay it is an effuſion of his Eſſence into the ſoul of the Bleſſed, an emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Divinity communicating all his perfections, lifting them above themſelves; and transforming them into him without deſtroying them, makes as many Gods as there are Saints in Glory. The Fire which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints all its qualities in the Iron it makes red-hot; the Sun that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates all his light to the Cryſtal he penetrates; and the Perſume which ſheds its fragrant odour thorow all the rooms it embalms, are but faint compariſons to expreſs the intimate communication of the Divine Eſſence to the Bleſſed. It is enough to believe in the ſimplicity of Faith that all our deſires ſhall be fully compleated; that our happineſs ſhall ſurpaſs our hopes; and, raiſed to a higher condition then that the devil promiſed our father in Paradiſe, we ſhall be Men and Gods both together.</p>
                  <p>Though we are not idle in ſo happie a condition, S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that the knowledge and love of God ſhall be our ſole employment:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tantum gande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt Beati quantum ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt; tantum amabunt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cognoſcent Deum.</hi> Aug. lib. Medit.</note> we ſhall finde all our contentment in this one exerciſe; and as we ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs All Goods in the Supreme Good, ſo ſhall we taſte all Felicity in this one diverſion: The good works we have been converſant in upon earth, ſhall be baniſhed from Glory; and Mercy ſhall be uſeleſs in a ſtate whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miſery cannot approach: we ſhall have no need to viſit the Sick, where Immortality provides for the Health of the Bleſſed: There will be no burying of the Dead in the land of the Living: Hoſpitality will not be practiſed where there are no Pilgrims: We ſhall not clothe the Naked, becauſe the light of Glory will be the garment of the Saints: We ſhall not be troubled to reconcile Enemies, becauſe Peace ſhall raign there eternally: We ſhall be no longer obliged to inſtruct the Simple, becauſe the Beatifical Viſion will eliminate all Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>If the works of Mercy be uſeleſs, all actions wherein Neceſſity enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth us will then be ſuperfluous. The miſeries of life compel men to till the earth for their nouriſhment, to build houſes to defend them from the injury of the weather, to make clothes to protect them from ſhame and cold: But all theſe employments ſhall have an end in a Kingdom where he that governs is both the Nouriſhment, the Cloathing, and the Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Subjects: His Goodneſs, which penetrates them, is their Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; his Glory, that invirons them, is their Apparel; and his Eſſence, which includes them, is their Lodging: They need fear nothing in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition where the poſſeſſion of All Good neceſſarily produceth the excluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115672:205"/>of All Evil. We ſhall have no apprehenſion then, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that Hunger or Thirſt ſhall perſecute us, becauſe we ſhall lodge in the houſe of a Lord where there is plenty of all things, where we may bathe our elves in the River of his Innocent Pleaſures. Nor Heat nor Cold ſhall once dare to annoy us, becauſe, by a ſtrange wonder, the ſame Sun that ſhall ſhelter us with his ſhadow, ſhall warm us with his heat: Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs ſhall not weaken us, becauſe God ſhall be our ſtrength: we ſhall not be forced to ſleep, becauſe Labour ſhall never need repoſe; nor ſhall the night ever draw a curtain over the day: There ſhall be no Commerce, becauſe we ſhall poſſeſs All in God: there ſhall be no Servitude, becauſe all the Subjects of this Kingdom ſhall be Soveraigns.</p>
                  <p>If you ask me, ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> what we ſhall do then in a place whence pain and travel are baniſhed: I will anſwer with the Prophet, that the whole enployment of the Bleſſed is to think of God, and to rejoyce in his glory. <hi>Vacate &amp; videte, quoniam ego ſum Deus.</hi> This meditation ſhall altogether take them up; it ſhall produce all pleaſures, and conſtitute all their vertues: Every Beatified perſon ſhall imitate <hi>Mary Magdalene;</hi> and as with her they ſhall have but one Object, they ſhall make uſe but of one Vertue; <hi>Porro unum est neceſſarium.</hi> The calamities of the Earth oblige us to employ ſucceſſively all the Vertues: ſometimes we borrow aid from Prudence to diſſipate the darkneſs wherewith we are blinded, or to ſcatter the dangers that threaten us: ſometimes we call in Continence to our relief, to defend us from pleaſures that tickle us: ſometimes we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand help of Fortitude, to combat griefs that aſſault us: ſometimes we throw our ſelves into the arms of Juſtice, to deliver us from enemies that oppreſs us: But in Heaven all theſe Vertues are idle, onely Charity is active, and yet reſts in acting; her action is to love what ſhe ſees; her reſt to poſſeſs what ſhe loves; and her felicity to know that ſhe ſhall never loſe what ſhe enjoys. If you cannot ſuffer, ſaith S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that the Vertues to which we owe Heaven be baniſhed thence, imagine them there more for your ornament then defence: never conceive that they fight, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelves that they triumph; and, having vanquiſhed all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, enjoy a Peace which ſhall endure for all Eternity.</p>

                  <head>The Ninth DISCOURSE. <hi>That the Chriſtians Soul and Body ſhall finde their Perfection in Beatitude.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MAn is ſuch a hidden Creature that he cannot well be known without Faith: He is miſtaken as often as he intends to paſs judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf; and the errours that have appeared in his own definition, have given us occaſion to conclude that he was ignorant of his own eſſence: when he conſulted his Senſe, he believed he was nothing but a Body; and if there were a ſpirit that informed him, it was periſhable and mortal: when he conſulted his Pride, he conceited himſelf a pure Spirit, which, either for his penalty, or for his trial, was included in a Body as in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from which he ſhould be delivered by death. Theſe two errours produced two grand diſorders in the world: The firſt engaged Man in the love of his Body, and the oblivion of his Soul: he made no account but of ſenſual Pleaſures; and knowing no life but the preſent, never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf about the future: He was of opinion that Death was the end of his Being; and that nothing remaining of him after his diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he need fear neither any Puniſhment, nor expect any Recompence. The ſecond errour made him ſo mightily undervalue his Body, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pined at it as a Slave, and handled it as a Rebel: he had recourſe many times to Death, that being delivered from this enemy, he might mix with pure Intelligences, and raign with Gods or Devils.</p>
                  <p>Faith, which corrects our errours, obligeth us to believe that Man is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Angel nor a Beaſt; that he is compounded of a Body and a Soul; and if he have the Firſt common with Beaſts, he hath the Second common with Angels: The ſame Faith perſwades him that Death deprives him of his body but for a time onely, that at the General Reſurrection it ſhall be re-united to the ſoul, to partake of its good or bad fortune. Therefore, treating here of the felicity of Chriſtians, I am neceſſarily to ſpeak of the two parts that compoſe them, and of the different happineſs the Divine Juſtice prepares for them reſpectively.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmuch as the ſoul is the nobleſt, ſhe is alſo moſt happily provided for, and her Beatitude infinitely ſurpaſſeth that of the body.

<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115672:206"/>by a ſupply, which, being much more powerful then that of Grace, raiſeth her to a condition wherein ſhe cannot deſert the good, nor embrace the evil; and where, as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, ſhe is in a happy impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to wander from her duty, and eſtrange her ſelf from the Supream good: Aſſurance ſucceeds in the place of fear, reſt in ſtead of conflicts, triumphs after victories: ſhe is no longer conſtrained to reſiſt the motions of the fleſh, becauſe this rebell is become obedient; and loſing in the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection whatever he drew from <hi>Adam</hi> at his Birth, hath now none but juſt and holy inclinations. The Spirit is no longer buſied to maintain a war againſt ſin, becauſe this Monſter cannot enter Heaven: he groans not now under the revolt of the paſſions; and as all the vertues are peaceable, they finde neither enemies to ſubdue, nor rebels to tame: Her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is no longer accompanied with doubts and darkneſs; ſhe learnes without labour; is not afraid to forget; and drawing light and wiſdom from the very Fountain, knows all things in their Principles. In this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition there remains nothing for the Chriſtian to wiſh for; his ſoul is penetrated by the Divine Eſſence; his underſtanding clarified with the light of glory; his will inflamed with the love of God; and all his powers and faculties finding their particular perfection in one object, he confeſſeth that the promiſes of God exceed his hopes.</p>
                  <p>Though his body have been polluted by his birth, and corrupted by death, it findes life in the Reſurrection, and Purity in Glory: For aſſoon as the Trumpet of the Angel ſhall have declared the will of God, every ſoul ſhal reaſſume her own body; &amp; reuniting her ſelf with it, ſhall give it a part in her happineſs: The greatneſs of this wonder hath found no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the mindes of Philoſophers; though they were perſwaded of the Immortality of the ſoul, they would not conſent to the Reſurrection of the body; and having ſeen it made a prey to wilde Beaſts, or fuel for the flames, they judged there was no power in the world could reſtore it again: The ſpirit of man hath favoured this errour, and believing his eyes rather then his light, could not finde in his heart to place that part of man in heaven which he ſaw committed to the grave; he was afraid to weary the power of the Almighty, if he ſhould oblige him to ſo many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and not comprehending how a body reduc'd to powder or ſmoak, could take its primitive form, choſe rather to leave it in the Earth, then draw it thence with ſo much violence.</p>
                  <p>But had he thought of the Creation, he had never doubted of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; and Reaſon her ſelf had perſwaded him, that ſeeing God was able to finde the body in Non-Entity, where it was not, he might very well finde it in the waters or in the ſlames where there was yet ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder thereof. If Nothing were not rebellious to him, Nature cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainly will not be diſobedient; and if he could make that which was not, he may as eaſily repair what now is not. Nothing periſheth in reſpect of the Creator; the dead are not leſs his ſubjects then thoſe that never were
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115672:206"/>born; and if he could make Non-Entity hear him, he may well make death obey him. The miracle of Reſurrection is perhaps attended with more pomp then that of the Creation, but there is leſs difficulty in it; and he that could vanquiſh the diſtance between Entity and Non-Entity, will have no great matter to do to maſter the oppoſition between Life and Death.</p>
                  <p>Finally, our Creator never loſes his right over his creatures; they are at his diſpoſal in what place ſoever they are: Their changing of form makes them not change condition; and becauſe they paſs thorow three or four Elements, they depend not leſſe upon his Omnipotence: The body of man is always the work of God; and he may after its corruption reſtore its beauty, and re-unite it to the ſoul, like a wiſe Artiſt having reduced a ſtatue to powder, may by his skil reſtore it to the primitive form. All the difficulties our ſpirit can ſuggeſt in this miracle, are eaſily maſter'd by him that can do all things; and having well weighed the wonders of the Creation, it will be no hard matter to comprehend thoſe of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Inaſmch as the body receives life in this, and is re-united with the ſoul, it is happily delivered from all the miſeries it had contracted in its birth or during its life: If Nature were miſtaken in forming it, the Authour of Nature corrects the faults in raiſing it: He gives it its juſt dimenſion, its lawful proportion; and retrenching whatever was ſuperfluous, makes it a compleat piece. But becauſe it is not enough to take away the defects to render it happy, God gives it advantages in glory which it had not in innocence: For although the body before it was infected with ſin, was not rebellious againſt the minde, nor ſubject to grief and death; it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs capable of corruption; The Natural heat conſumed the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and the waſte it made, was to be repaired by nouriſhment: Though he were obedient, yet was he an Animal; and though he felt no diſorders, yet was he liable to infirmities: his weight would have hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from following his ſoul to Heaven; he could not walk upon the water, nor penetrate the Chryſtal; and had he not prevented hunger and thirſt by eating and drinking, he had never held out againſt griefe and death: Finally, though he enjoyed the priviledges of Original Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he wanted thoſe of Glory; and though innocent, was neither incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible nor illuminated.</p>
                  <p>But in the Reſurrection he ſhall receive all theſe qualities; and as the ſoul is now corporeal, becauſe wholly engaged in the body; by a happy retaliation the body will be ſpiritual, becauſe perfectly ſubmitted to the ſoul; and as the ſoul, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> though corporeal, ceaſeth not to be a ſpirit; the body, though ſpiritual, ceaſeth not to be a body: It will change condition, though it change not nature, and will have advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which ſhall ſet it free from all the miſeries it now endures. Its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty will ſurpaſs that of the light; will penetrate all ſolid bodies; nothing
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:115672:207"/>ſhall be able to withſtand its deſires, and being no longer the Priſon but the Temple of his ſoul, will find no obſtacles that ſtop it, nor chains that intangle it. Its agility will be ſo great that it will outſtrip the winds and lightning; will fly without wings thorow the ſpacious regions of the air; will walk upon the water and not ſink; and in a moment paſſing from one end of the world to another, will be no longer the clog and torment of the ſoul. Its impaſſibility will free it from all the injuries of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Elements: the naturall heat which now conſumes him, ſhall no more corrode the naturall Moiſture; The Contraries that compoſe him will agree; and being no longer tormented with hunger and thirſt, will ſtand in need neither of meat nor drink.</p>
                  <p>He will be in a ſtate of conſiſtency, wherein he will have his juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion; nor will he expect from time, his youth or old age; he will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy an eternall ſpring of years which will never wither; he will ſee the dayes paſſe on, and never feel any declenſion in himſelf; his budding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure will fear no winter; the Lillies and the Roſes of his countenance will keep their freſhneſs: and as original righteouſneſs ſerved for a Garment for innocent man, glory will be inſteed of a robe to the bleſſed: His bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſurpaſs that of the Sun; the raies which dart from his eyes will dim thoſe of this Glorious Luminary; and he will caſt ſuch lights and flames, that the leaſt glorified Body will be able to illuminate the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe.</p>
                  <p>His immortality will be the Crown of his Happineſs. That pittileſſe monſter which exerciſeth his rigour upon all men, purſues them into the Grave, reduceth them to powder after the worms have devoured them: This Cruell one, I ſay, will have no more power over the Bleſſed; he will diſcharge his fury upon the damned in Hell; he will make a league with life to torment them Eternally; and that which endures here but for a moment, will laſt for ever in that diſmall habitation, to lengthen their pains according to the obſtinacy of their crimes: But he will reſpect his Conquerors; and beholding the Bleſſed as the Members of him that hath defeated him upon the Croſſe, will not dare to ſet upon them afreſh, nor ſo much as appear in their preſence. Then ſhall the happineſſe of men be perfect, when a glorified ſoul ſhall inanimate an immortall Body; and mutually communicating all their advantages, the ſoul ſhall be happy in the felicity of the Body, and the Body happy in that of the Soul. All their differences ſhall be compoſed in this General peace; the Soul ſhall forget all the Revolts of the Body, nor ſhall the Body any more complain of the ſeverities of the Soul, but both of them remembring onely the Good offices they have done each other; they ſhall reign in Heaven in a Community of Glory, as they lived upon Earth in a Community of Merits.</p>
                  <p>But to arrive to this Happy condition, the Spirit muſt war againſt the Fleſh, and Repentance give the faithfull thoſe Priviledges Glory inſtates
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115672:207"/>the Bleſſed in. For though there be nothing more oppoſite to Reſt then a Conflict, yet is it the Conflict that gains us the victory,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ex bello pax; pugna enim nos praeparat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae; victoria no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis obtinet tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphum.</hi> Chry.</note> and the victory that procures us the peace: Though there be nothing more contrary to Happineſs theu Pain; it is notwithſtanding auſterity that ſubjects the Body to the Soul, and makes us ſee in our Baniſhment a perfect Image of Glory.</p>
                  <p>For if it be true that the Bleſſed feel no Rebellion in their perſon, and if their Body be perfectly ſubjected to their minde, we muſt acknowledg that the Chriſtian cannot pretend to any part of this advantage, but by the help of repentance: It is this vertue that tames the Pride of the fleſh; this faithfull miniſter of the Divine Juſtice which makes Charity reign in ſpite of Concupiſcence; and all the peace we have in the earth, we owe it to the zeal and auſterity of crucifixion. If the Bleſſed be diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged from the world; if their condition be ſeparated from ours; and, if finding all things in the Divine Eſſence, meat, cloaths, and lodging be uſeleſs to them, it ſeems Repentance puts us in the ſame Liberty; and reducing us to things abſolutely neceſſary, rids us of ſuperfluities: This is it that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines the Anchorites to their pulſe, that gives them ſackcloath for a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Den for a Lodging, a Mat for their Bed: This is it that enricheth them, by making them poor; makes them finde Liberty in ſervitude; and equalling their condition with that of Angels, frees them from the need we have of the Creatures.</p>
                  <p>If the Bleſſed have no communication but with God; if they have quitted Earth to live in Paradiſe; if the Love and Magnificats they beſtow upon God be their whole employment; and if in this one object they finde all their Happineſs and their Diverſion; Pennance and Solitude pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſame priviledges to the faithfull: Their heart is no longer in the Earth; they mount up to heaven by their deſires; converſe more with Angels then with Men; and already enjoying the priviledges of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, lead a new life in their Baniſhment, and a happy life in their wilderneſs. Let us imitate their holy Examples; fit our ſelves for Glory by Auſterity; and ſubjecting the Body to the ſoul, and the ſoul to God; ſet us to ſhake hands with the world, that our Converſation may be with Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>AS Nature and Grace have their extraordinary proceedings, ſo have they their Miracles;

When the Sun ſtands ſtill in the midſt of his courſe; when the Earth cleaves from her founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and opens her bowels to devour her Children; when the ſea paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his bounds, and makes inquiſition after Delinquents beyond his Banks; There is no body but looks upon theſe irregularities as Prodigies, and who conceives not that the author of Nature diſorders her to puniſh us. Though Grace be ſo powerfull, and its victorious ſweetneſs ſo often tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over the libertie of ſinners, it many times produceth occurrences which paſs for Miracles: When it converted the Doctor of the world, diſarmed his heart and his hands, and changing his will in a moment, of a Perſecutor made him an Apoſtle, it ſeems ſo ſtrange a proceeding may well be ranked in the number of prodigies: when it touched that Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian who laughed at the Ceremonies of our Religion, enlightened his ſpirit upon the Theatre, made uſe of the water he prophaned, to make a Sacrament, and by a wonderfull conduct made him finde his ſalvation in his very ſin; we ſhall not offend its power, if we call this effect a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
                  <p>If Nature and Grace have their Prodigies, Glory, which is their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, may boaſt of thoſe it hath: and as its order is the higheſt, ſo is it moſt miraculous. Therefore did the Great S. <hi>Bernard</hi> confeſs, That there were Three Unions that raviſhed him: The firſt, That of Virginity with Pregnancy in the perſon of <hi>Mary:</hi> The ſecond, That of the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Divinity in the perſon of the Word; and the Third, That of Glory with the ſpirit of Man in the perſon of the Bleſſed. For he could not comprehend how it came to paſs that the Creature was not dazled with the brightneſs of the Creator; that a drop of water ſhould not be loſt in an Ocean; and that an Atome ſhould be preſerved in the Abyſſes of a Divine Eſſence: But certainly he that ſhall well conſider the ſtate of Glory, will finde it a perpetuall Miracle; and that the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that accompany it are ſo many Prodigies, whereof the firſt is, that God communicates himſelf entirely to every one of the Bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Goods of the earth are ſuch ſcantlings, that they cannot be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:115672:208"/>without being diminiſhed: we raviſh that from our neighbour, which we poſſeſs our ſelves; we cannot grow rich, but muſt inaccommodate him; and whatever care we take not to deal unjuſtly, we finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that our Plenty is an occaſion of Miſery and Indigence to others. Monarchs cannot enlarge the borders of their State, but muſt encroach upon thoſe of their Neighbours; they cannot widen their own Kingdom, but muſt make a breach in that of their Allies; and all worldly things are ſo ſmall, that, being ſhared, occaſions the diviſion and poverty of Families. But inaſmuch as the Good which the Bleſſed are in poſſeſſion of is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, it is communicated to all without being divided: The Felicity of one is no hinderance to that of another; and as Vertue, though common, is nevertheleſs chaſte; the Divine Eſſence, though wholly ſhed abroad into a man, ceaſeth not to be entirely infuſed into an Angel: It takes not from the Cherubims what it indulgeth the Seraphims; and communicating it ſelf indiviſibly to all its Subjects, occaſions neither Jealouſie nor Envie.</p>
                  <p>Great Goods have this advantage, that they never ſuffer by diviſion:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Magna &amp; vera bona non ſic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduntur ut ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iguum in ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los cadat, ad unumquemque totu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perveniat.</hi> Sen. Ep. 73.</note> They make ſome rich, without making others poor; and as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in full weight and meaſure, every one is content, and none miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Covetouſneſs, which hath divided Sea and Land, hath not yet divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Time: That which meaſures the life of Kings, meaſures that of their Subjects: every one poſſeſſeth it in common; and though we make divers uſes of it, it runs along equally to all people. Ambition, which hath cantonized Honour, hath not yet found out the Secret of parting the Light; this daughter of the Sun never thinks ſhe ſullies her purity by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it common; ſhe equally ſhines upon all Nations; and did not the Earth interpoſe between the effuſion of her brightneſs, ſhe would baniſh Darkneſs from the face of the Univerſe. The Divine Eſſence, whereof the Light is but a ſhadow, is ſhed abroad into the ſoul of the Bleſſed without being divided; is not parted by being communicated: All An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and all Men fully poſſeſs it; and if it make ſome difference in their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, 'tis without want or jealouſie.</p>
                  <p>The Second miracle of Glory, is, that one and the ſame Good produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all kinde of content, and ſatisfies all ſorts of deſires. Seeing the Creatures are but weak rays iſſuing from God, as from their Sun, there is none of them that poſſeſſeth all perfections:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nullum eſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num praeter ſummum, quo vere poſſimus eſſe boni aut beati.</hi> Aug.</note> They are bounded in their Qualities, as well as in their Eſſences: They cannot relieve us in all our neceſſities; and had not ſin made them rebel againſt us, there was not one of them could remedy our evils: Light enlightens us, but cannot warm us without its heat: Meat nouriſheth, but clothes us not: Garments co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, but cannot feed us: Gold enricheth, but cannot defend us: Iron defends, but does not enrich us. One Good produceth but one ſingle commodity: that which ſerves for one uſe, does not for another; and the remedy which cures a Diſeaſe, cannot give conſolation to a Diſcontent. But the Bleſſed have this advantage, that they finde in God whatever is
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:115672:209"/>neceſſary for them: having all Perfections, he fully contents their deſires; and one ſole Good infuſed into their ſouls, ſatisfies all their wants: He that enlightens them, warms them; he that feeds them, clothes them; he that lodges them, protects them; he that imparts his perfections in ſeveral por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Saints here belowe, communicates them all together to the Bleſſed; and, to expreſs my ſelf in the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> his diſciple, God is All to All in Glory; nor can we form any wiſhes whereof we finde not the accompliſhment in his poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The Third Miracle is, that the deſire is not reſtleſs in heaven. Thoſe that are well acquainted with our Paſſions, confeſs there is none more cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el then Deſire: For though it ſeem to ſupply us in our need, we may ſay that the Remedy is more troubleſome then the Diſeaſe, and that it were better to retrench the moſt part of worldly things, then to be troubled with longing for them. This Paſſion puts us not upon the ſearch of Good but by means of Grief; 'tis a ſpur which wounds us to make us go, a needle that goads us to make us run, a tranſportation of the ſoul which renders us miſerable to render us happie. Thence it comes to paſs that Divines, agreeing with Philoſophers, profeſs that Deſires are the chiefeſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Damned; that theſe delinquents are therefore wretched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deſires are hopeleſs,
<note place="margin">

But, by an unconceiveable wonder, the Bleſſed deſire, and are not at all diſquieted; they enjoy what they long for, ſee what they hope; and as the Goodneſs of God occaſions their wiſhes, his Preſence begets their felicity: The Good they deſire, is not abſent; the Good they poſſeſs, is not weariſome; and mixing Deſire with Fruition, they are everlaſtingly happie. They long, ſaith S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> and their longing cauſeth no doleance, becauſe, as ſoon as formed, 'tis turned into joy; and the preſence of the God they covet, baniſheth pain, and cauſeth content.</p>
                  <p>This Miracle produceth a Fourth, which makes the Bleſſed finde a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion which never diſguſts them.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Duo ſunt torto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res cruci atum alternantes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, &amp; timor; ſi bene es times, ſi male es doles.</hi> Aug.</note> Men cannot avoid being upon Earth; and as Grief and Fear are two Paſſions which ſucceed to give them no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, Fruition and Deſire are two ſtates which alternately torment them. Deſire is always attended with Reſtleſneſs: every man that makes Vows, and puts up Requeſts, declares publikely his want and miſery; and though raiſed to never ſo high a pitch of Fortune, tells all the world that he ſuffers becauſe he deſires. Fruition, which ſeems the period and acquieſcence of Deſires, and which, by a neceſſary conſequence, ought to baniſh Grief out of the ſoul, begets a ſapleſs cloying of the appetite, and condemns him to a puniſhment whereof he hath no right to complain, becauſe himſelf ſeems to have courted it. In the mean time, this misfortune is ſo common, that there is no body but experienceth it: and the goods of the Earth are ſo mean and beggerly, that we cannot have them, but we muſt deſpiſe them. Their abſence troubles us, and their preſence cloys us;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:115672:209"/>we make ſome account of them at a diſtance, but when we approach them, and taſte the fruition of them, we diſcover their imperfections, are aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, or diſreliſh them: ſo that in whatever condition Fortune place us, we cannot chuſe but be miſerable. But the happineſs which the Bleſſed enjoy is ſo great, that as their Deſires occaſion not their Impatience, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth their felicity nauſeate into a diſtaſte; They daily diſcover new beauties in this infinite object; they finde more ſweetneſſes then were promiſed them; and confeſs that their happineſs exceeds their hopes. The Faithful have leſs love, becauſe leſs light; preſent things diſtract them; their ſenſes which are at agreement with what they ſee, ſeduce them; and, becauſe they can form no noble Ideas of the Supream Good, the deſires they have towards it are faint and languiſhing: But inaſmuch as the Bleſſed know all the advantages it is attended with, their love en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth with their light; their pleaſure is augmented by fruition; and far diſtant from conceiving any diſreliſh, their deſire continues in the height of poſſeſſion, and they wiſh without pain, what they poſſeſſe with aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>But the laſt miracle of glory, and which is no whit inferiour to the reſt, is, that the difference of conditions cauſeth no jealouſie. The variety of the world is one of its rareſt ornaments:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tota Naturae pulchritudo aut certe praecipuae in ſua varietate ſita, eſt nec abeſt à varietate utilitas.</hi> Marſ. Fiſc.</note> The ſlowers which checker a walk imbelliſh it; The Stars which make a hundred ſeverall Figures in the Firmament, ſet a luſtre upon its beauty; neither doth any thing make a Countrey more pleaſant, then the diverſity of the parts that compoſe it: Our eyes are raviſhed to behold rivulets creeping along the Meadows; Fields ſtretching themſelves out of ſight; Valleys which ſink as low as the Center of the Earth, and Mountains which ſtrike Heaven with their tops. The Riches and Beauty of a State depends upon its diverſity; if all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were of the ſame condition, there would be neither diverſion for ſtrangers, nor accommodation for the Naturals: The Ornament and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Body Politick, appears in this agreeable mixture of Poor and Rich, Artiſts and Husbandmen, Soldiers and Merchants, Magiſtrates and Prieſts. But it falls out by an inevitable misfortune, that this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of conditions which begets its beauty, breeeds jealouſie among the ſubjects: For as their goods are not common, becauſe their conditions are different, one is jealous of what the other poſſeſſeth: The Grandees are proud, and deſpiſe their inferiours; the mean men are envious, and murmure at the Optimacy;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cum erit Deus omnia in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, qui minus habebunt non abhorrebunt; ubi enim nulla eſt invidentia, concors eſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia.</hi> Aug.</note> Every condition carries its own torment along with it; Greatneſs is tortured with Pride, and Miſery afflicted with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy: But in Heaven the difference of conditions produceth their beauty, and gives no occaſion of jealouſie. All the Saints hold different ſtations, their merit is the meaſure of their glory, their crowns are proportionable to their labours, and there is more variety in the Bleſſed then among the Stars. In the mean time Peace bears rule in the diverſity of their conditions; Charity, which unites them, renders their contentment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
